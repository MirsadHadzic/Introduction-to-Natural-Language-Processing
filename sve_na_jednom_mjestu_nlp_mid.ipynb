      "\r\n",
      "A few words about Dostoevsky himself may help the English reader to\r\n",
      "understand his work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dostoevsky was the son of a doctor. His parents were very hard-working\r\n",
      "and deeply religious people, but so poor that they lived with their five\r\n",
      "children in only two rooms. The father and mother spent their evenings\r\n",
      "in reading aloud to their children, generally from books of a serious\r\n",
      "character.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though always sickly and delicate Dostoevsky came out third in the\r\n",
      "final examination of the Petersburg school of Engineering. There he had\r\n",
      "already begun his first work, “Poor Folk.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This story was published by the poet Nekrassov in his review and\r\n",
      "was received with acclamations. The shy, unknown youth found himself\r\n",
      "instantly something of a celebrity. A brilliant and successful career\r\n",
      "seemed to open before him, but those hopes were soon dashed. In 1849 he\r\n",
      "was arrested.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky\r\n",
      "was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier\r\n",
      "and Proudhon. He was accused of “taking part in conversations against\r\n",
      "the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of\r\n",
      "knowing of the intention to set up a printing press.” Under Nicholas\r\n",
      "I. (that “stern and just man,” as Maurice Baring calls him) this was\r\n",
      "enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months’ imprisonment\r\n",
      "he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to\r\n",
      "be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: “They snapped\r\n",
      "words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by\r\n",
      "persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes,\r\n",
      "to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only\r\n",
      "a few minutes of life before me. I thought of you and your dear ones and\r\n",
      "I contrived to kiss Plestcheiev and Dourov, who were next to me, and to\r\n",
      "bid them farewell. Suddenly the troops beat a tattoo, we were unbound,\r\n",
      "brought back upon the scaffold, and informed that his Majesty had spared\r\n",
      "us our lives.” The sentence was commuted to hard labour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the prisoners, Grigoryev, went mad as soon as he was untied, and\r\n",
      "never regained his sanity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The intense suffering of this experience left a lasting stamp on\r\n",
      "Dostoevsky’s mind. Though his religious temper led him in the end to\r\n",
      "accept every suffering with resignation and to regard it as a blessing\r\n",
      "in his own case, he constantly recurs to the subject in his writings.\r\n",
      "He describes the awful agony of the condemned man and insists on the\r\n",
      "cruelty of inflicting such torture. Then followed four years of penal\r\n",
      "servitude, spent in the company of common criminals in Siberia, where\r\n",
      "he began the “Dead House,” and some years of service in a disciplinary\r\n",
      "battalion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had shown signs of some obscure nervous disease before his arrest\r\n",
      "and this now developed into violent attacks of epilepsy, from which he\r\n",
      "suffered for the rest of his life. The fits occurred three or four times\r\n",
      "a year and were more frequent in periods of great strain. In 1859 he was\r\n",
      "allowed to return to Russia. He started a journal--“Vremya,” which was\r\n",
      "forbidden by the Censorship through a misunderstanding. In 1864 he lost\r\n",
      "his first wife and his brother Mihail. He was in terrible poverty, yet\r\n",
      "he took upon himself the payment of his brother’s debts. He started\r\n",
      "another journal--“The Epoch,” which within a few months was also\r\n",
      "prohibited. He was weighed down by debt, his brother’s family was\r\n",
      "dependent on him, he was forced to write at heart-breaking speed, and is\r\n",
      "said never to have corrected his work. The later years of his life were\r\n",
      "much softened by the tenderness and devotion of his second wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In June 1880 he made his famous speech at the unveiling of the\r\n",
      "monument to Pushkin in Moscow and he was received with extraordinary\r\n",
      "demonstrations of love and honour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few months later Dostoevsky died. He was followed to the grave by a\r\n",
      "vast multitude of mourners, who “gave the hapless man the funeral of a\r\n",
      "king.” He is still probably the most widely read writer in Russia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the words of a Russian critic, who seeks to explain the feeling\r\n",
      "inspired by Dostoevsky: “He was one of ourselves, a man of our blood and\r\n",
      "our bone, but one who has suffered and has seen so much more deeply than\r\n",
      "we have his insight impresses us as wisdom... that wisdom of the heart\r\n",
      "which we seek that we may learn from it how to live. All his other\r\n",
      "gifts came to him from nature, this he won for himself and through it he\r\n",
      "became great.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On an exceptionally hot evening early in July a young man came out of\r\n",
      "the garret in which he lodged in S. Place and walked slowly, as though\r\n",
      "in hesitation, towards K. bridge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had successfully avoided meeting his landlady on the staircase. His\r\n",
      "garret was under the roof of a high, five-storied house and was more\r\n",
      "like a cupboard than a room. The landlady who provided him with garret,\r\n",
      "dinners, and attendance, lived on the floor below, and every time\r\n",
      "he went out he was obliged to pass her kitchen, the door of which\r\n",
      "invariably stood open. And each time he passed, the young man had a\r\n",
      "sick, frightened feeling, which made him scowl and feel ashamed. He was\r\n",
      "hopelessly in debt to his landlady, and was afraid of meeting her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was not because he was cowardly and abject, quite the contrary; but\r\n",
      "for some time past he had been in an overstrained irritable condition,\r\n",
      "verging on hypochondria. He had become so completely absorbed in\r\n",
      "himself, and isolated from his fellows that he dreaded meeting, not\r\n",
      "only his landlady, but anyone at all. He was crushed by poverty, but the\r\n",
      "anxieties of his position had of late ceased to weigh upon him. He had\r\n",
      "given up attending to matters of practical importance; he had lost all\r\n",
      "desire to do so. Nothing that any landlady could do had a real terror\r\n",
      "for him. But to be stopped on the stairs, to be forced to listen to her\r\n",
      "trivial, irrelevant gossip, to pestering demands for payment, threats\r\n",
      "and complaints, and to rack his brains for excuses, to prevaricate, to\r\n",
      "lie--no, rather than that, he would creep down the stairs like a cat and\r\n",
      "slip out unseen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This evening, however, on coming out into the street, he became acutely\r\n",
      "aware of his fears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want to attempt a thing _like that_ and am frightened by these\r\n",
      "trifles,” he thought, with an odd smile. “Hm... yes, all is in a man’s\r\n",
      "hands and he lets it all slip from cowardice, that’s an axiom. It would\r\n",
      "be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new\r\n",
      "step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking\r\n",
      "too much. It’s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is\r\n",
      "that I chatter because I do nothing. I’ve learned to chatter this\r\n",
      "last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the\r\n",
      "Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of _that_? Is\r\n",
      "_that_ serious? It is not serious at all. It’s simply a fantasy to amuse\r\n",
      "myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The heat in the street was terrible: and the airlessness, the bustle\r\n",
      "and the plaster, scaffolding, bricks, and dust all about him, and that\r\n",
      "special Petersburg stench, so familiar to all who are unable to get out\r\n",
      "of town in summer--all worked painfully upon the young man’s already\r\n",
      "overwrought nerves. The insufferable stench from the pot-houses, which\r\n",
      "are particularly numerous in that part of the town, and the drunken men\r\n",
      "whom he met continually, although it was a working day, completed\r\n",
      "the revolting misery of the picture. An expression of the profoundest\r\n",
      "disgust gleamed for a moment in the young man’s refined face. He was,\r\n",
      "by the way, exceptionally handsome, above the average in height, slim,\r\n",
      "well-built, with beautiful dark eyes and dark brown hair. Soon he sank\r\n",
      "into deep thought, or more accurately speaking into a complete blankness\r\n",
      "of mind; he walked along not observing what was about him and not caring\r\n",
      "to observe it. From time to time, he would mutter something, from the\r\n",
      "habit of talking to himself, to which he had just confessed. At these\r\n",
      "moments he would become conscious that his ideas were sometimes in a\r\n",
      "tangle and that he was very weak; for two days he had scarcely tasted\r\n",
      "food.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was so badly dressed that even a man accustomed to shabbiness would\r\n",
      "have been ashamed to be seen in the street in such rags. In that quarter\r\n",
      "of the town, however, scarcely any shortcoming in dress would have\r\n",
      "created surprise. Owing to the proximity of the Hay Market, the number\r\n",
      "of establishments of bad character, the preponderance of the trading\r\n",
      "and working class population crowded in these streets and alleys in the\r\n",
      "heart of Petersburg, types so various were to be seen in the streets\r\n",
      "that no figure, however queer, would have caused surprise. But there was\r\n",
      "such accumulated bitterness and contempt in the young man’s heart, that,\r\n",
      "in spite of all the fastidiousness of youth, he minded his rags least\r\n",
      "of all in the street. It was a different matter when he met with\r\n",
      "acquaintances or with former fellow students, whom, indeed, he disliked\r\n",
      "meeting at any time. And yet when a drunken man who, for some unknown\r\n",
      "reason, was being taken somewhere in a huge waggon dragged by a heavy\r\n",
      "dray horse, suddenly shouted at him as he drove past: “Hey there, German\r\n",
      "hatter” bawling at the top of his voice and pointing at him--the young\r\n",
      "man stopped suddenly and clutched tremulously at his hat. It was a tall\r\n",
      "round hat from Zimmerman’s, but completely worn out, rusty with age, all\r\n",
      "torn and bespattered, brimless and bent on one side in a most unseemly\r\n",
      "fashion. Not shame, however, but quite another feeling akin to terror\r\n",
      "had overtaken him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew it,” he muttered in confusion, “I thought so! That’s the worst\r\n",
      "of all! Why, a stupid thing like this, the most trivial detail might\r\n",
      "spoil the whole plan. Yes, my hat is too noticeable.... It looks absurd\r\n",
      "and that makes it noticeable.... With my rags I ought to wear a cap, any\r\n",
      "sort of old pancake, but not this grotesque thing. Nobody wears such\r\n",
      "a hat, it would be noticed a mile off, it would be remembered.... What\r\n",
      "matters is that people would remember it, and that would give them\r\n",
      "a clue. For this business one should be as little conspicuous as\r\n",
      "possible.... Trifles, trifles are what matter! Why, it’s just such\r\n",
      "trifles that always ruin everything....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not far to go; he knew indeed how many steps it was from the gate\r\n",
      "of his lodging house: exactly seven hundred and thirty. He had counted\r\n",
      "them once when he had been lost in dreams. At the time he had put no\r\n",
      "faith in those dreams and was only tantalising himself by their hideous\r\n",
      "but daring recklessness. Now, a month later, he had begun to look upon\r\n",
      "them differently, and, in spite of the monologues in which he jeered at\r\n",
      "his own impotence and indecision, he had involuntarily come to regard\r\n",
      "this “hideous” dream as an exploit to be attempted, although he\r\n",
      "still did not realise this himself. He was positively going now for a\r\n",
      "“rehearsal” of his project, and at every step his excitement grew more\r\n",
      "and more violent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With a sinking heart and a nervous tremor, he went up to a huge house\r\n",
      "which on one side looked on to the canal, and on the other into the\r\n",
      "street. This house was let out in tiny tenements and was inhabited by\r\n",
      "working people of all kinds--tailors, locksmiths, cooks, Germans of\r\n",
      "sorts, girls picking up a living as best they could, petty clerks, etc.\r\n",
      "There was a continual coming and going through the two gates and in the\r\n",
      "two courtyards of the house. Three or four door-keepers were employed on\r\n",
      "the building. The young man was very glad to meet none of them, and\r\n",
      "at once slipped unnoticed through the door on the right, and up the\r\n",
      "staircase. It was a back staircase, dark and narrow, but he was familiar\r\n",
      "with it already, and knew his way, and he liked all these surroundings:\r\n",
      "in such darkness even the most inquisitive eyes were not to be dreaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I am so scared now, what would it be if it somehow came to pass that\r\n",
      "I were really going to do it?” he could not help asking himself as he\r\n",
      "reached the fourth storey. There his progress was barred by some porters\r\n",
      "who were engaged in moving furniture out of a flat. He knew that the\r\n",
      "flat had been occupied by a German clerk in the civil service, and his\r\n",
      "family. This German was moving out then, and so the fourth floor on this\r\n",
      "staircase would be untenanted except by the old woman. “That’s a good\r\n",
      "thing anyway,” he thought to himself, as he rang the bell of the old\r\n",
      "woman’s flat. The bell gave a faint tinkle as though it were made of\r\n",
      "tin and not of copper. The little flats in such houses always have bells\r\n",
      "that ring like that. He had forgotten the note of that bell, and now\r\n",
      "its peculiar tinkle seemed to remind him of something and to bring it\r\n",
      "clearly before him.... He started, his nerves were terribly overstrained\r\n",
      "by now. In a little while, the door was opened a tiny crack: the old\r\n",
      "woman eyed her visitor with evident distrust through the crack, and\r\n",
      "nothing could be seen but her little eyes, glittering in the darkness.\r\n",
      "But, seeing a number of people on the landing, she grew bolder, and\r\n",
      "opened the door wide. The young man stepped into the dark entry, which\r\n",
      "was partitioned off from the tiny kitchen. The old woman stood facing\r\n",
      "him in silence and looking inquiringly at him. She was a diminutive,\r\n",
      "withered up old woman of sixty, with sharp malignant eyes and a sharp\r\n",
      "little nose. Her colourless, somewhat grizzled hair was thickly smeared\r\n",
      "with oil, and she wore no kerchief over it. Round her thin long neck,\r\n",
      "which looked like a hen’s leg, was knotted some sort of flannel rag,\r\n",
      "and, in spite of the heat, there hung flapping on her shoulders, a mangy\r\n",
      "fur cape, yellow with age. The old woman coughed and groaned at every\r\n",
      "instant. The young man must have looked at her with a rather peculiar\r\n",
      "expression, for a gleam of mistrust came into her eyes again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Raskolnikov, a student, I came here a month ago,” the young man made\r\n",
      "haste to mutter, with a half bow, remembering that he ought to be more\r\n",
      "polite.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I remember, my good sir, I remember quite well your coming here,” the\r\n",
      "old woman said distinctly, still keeping her inquiring eyes on his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And here... I am again on the same errand,” Raskolnikov continued, a\r\n",
      "little disconcerted and surprised at the old woman’s mistrust. “Perhaps\r\n",
      "she is always like that though, only I did not notice it the other\r\n",
      "time,” he thought with an uneasy feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman paused, as though hesitating; then stepped on one side,\r\n",
      "and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass\r\n",
      "in front of her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Step in, my good sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on\r\n",
      "the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly\r\n",
      "lighted up at that moment by the setting sun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by\r\n",
      "chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned\r\n",
      "everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and\r\n",
      "remember its arrangement. But there was nothing special in the room. The\r\n",
      "furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with\r\n",
      "a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a\r\n",
      "dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows,\r\n",
      "chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow\r\n",
      "frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was\r\n",
      "all. In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon. Everything\r\n",
      "was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished;\r\n",
      "everything shone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man. There was not a speck of dust\r\n",
      "to be seen in the whole flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such\r\n",
      "cleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance\r\n",
      "at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in\r\n",
      "which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he\r\n",
      "had never looked before. These two rooms made up the whole flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room\r\n",
      "and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in\r\n",
      "the face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket\r\n",
      "an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a\r\n",
      "globe; the chain was of steel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But the time is up for your last pledge. The month was up the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell\r\n",
      "your pledge at once.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything.\r\n",
      "I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it\r\n",
      "quite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s. I\r\n",
      "shall be getting some money soon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A rouble and a half!” cried the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch. The\r\n",
      "young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going\r\n",
      "away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere\r\n",
      "else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hand it over,” he said roughly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind\r\n",
      "the curtain into the other room. The young man, left standing alone in\r\n",
      "the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking. He could hear\r\n",
      "her unlocking the chest of drawers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be the top drawer,” he reflected. “So she carries the keys in\r\n",
      "a pocket on the right. All in one bunch on a steel ring.... And there’s\r\n",
      "one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;\r\n",
      "that can’t be the key of the chest of drawers... then there must be some\r\n",
      "other chest or strong-box... that’s worth knowing. Strong-boxes always\r\n",
      "have keys like that... but how degrading it all is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman came back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here, sir: as we say ten copecks the rouble a month, so I must take\r\n",
      "fifteen copecks from a rouble and a half for the month in advance. But\r\n",
      "for the two roubles I lent you before, you owe me now twenty copecks\r\n",
      "on the same reckoning in advance. That makes thirty-five copecks\r\n",
      "altogether. So I must give you a rouble and fifteen copecks for the\r\n",
      "watch. Here it is.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! only a rouble and fifteen copecks now!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just so.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man did not dispute it and took the money. He looked at the\r\n",
      "old woman, and was in no hurry to get away, as though there was still\r\n",
      "something he wanted to say or to do, but he did not himself quite know\r\n",
      "what.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I may be bringing you something else in a day or two, Alyona\r\n",
      "Ivanovna--a valuable thing--silver--a cigarette-box, as soon as I get it\r\n",
      "back from a friend...” he broke off in confusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, we will talk about it then, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good-bye--are you always at home alone, your sister is not here with\r\n",
      "you?” He asked her as casually as possible as he went out into the\r\n",
      "passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What business is she of yours, my good sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, nothing particular, I simply asked. You are too quick.... Good-day,\r\n",
      "Alyona Ivanovna.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went out in complete confusion. This confusion became more\r\n",
      "and more intense. As he went down the stairs, he even stopped short, two\r\n",
      "or three times, as though suddenly struck by some thought. When he was\r\n",
      "in the street he cried out, “Oh, God, how loathsome it all is! and\r\n",
      "can I, can I possibly.... No, it’s nonsense, it’s rubbish!” he added\r\n",
      "resolutely. “And how could such an atrocious thing come into my head?\r\n",
      "What filthy things my heart is capable of. Yes, filthy above all,\r\n",
      "disgusting, loathsome, loathsome!--and for a whole month I’ve been....”\r\n",
      " But no words, no exclamations, could express his agitation. The feeling\r\n",
      "of intense repulsion, which had begun to oppress and torture his heart\r\n",
      "while he was on his way to the old woman, had by now reached such a\r\n",
      "pitch and had taken such a definite form that he did not know what to\r\n",
      "do with himself to escape from his wretchedness. He walked along the\r\n",
      "pavement like a drunken man, regardless of the passers-by, and jostling\r\n",
      "against them, and only came to his senses when he was in the next\r\n",
      "street. Looking round, he noticed that he was standing close to a tavern\r\n",
      "which was entered by steps leading from the pavement to the basement.\r\n",
      "At that instant two drunken men came out at the door, and abusing and\r\n",
      "supporting one another, they mounted the steps. Without stopping to\r\n",
      "think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had\r\n",
      "never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a\r\n",
      "burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his\r\n",
      "sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little\r\n",
      "table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank\r\n",
      "off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became\r\n",
      "clear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All that’s nonsense,” he said hopefully, “and there is nothing in it\r\n",
      "all to worry about! It’s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of\r\n",
      "beer, a piece of dry bread--and in one moment the brain is stronger,\r\n",
      "the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all\r\n",
      "is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But in spite of this scornful reflection, he was by now looking cheerful\r\n",
      "as though he were suddenly set free from a terrible burden: and he gazed\r\n",
      "round in a friendly way at the people in the room. But even at that\r\n",
      "moment he had a dim foreboding that this happier frame of mind was also\r\n",
      "not normal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were few people at the time in the tavern. Besides the two drunken\r\n",
      "men he had met on the steps, a group consisting of about five men and\r\n",
      "a girl with a concertina had gone out at the same time. Their departure\r\n",
      "left the room quiet and rather empty. The persons still in the tavern\r\n",

      "sitting before a pot of beer, and his companion, a huge, stout man with\r\n",
      "a grey beard, in a short full-skirted coat. He was very drunk: and had\r\n",
      "dropped asleep on the bench; every now and then, he began as though in\r\n",
      "his sleep, cracking his fingers, with his arms wide apart and the upper\r\n",

      "positive hostility and mistrust at all these manifestations. There was\r\n",
      "another man in the room who looked somewhat like a retired government\r\n",
      "clerk. He was sitting apart, now and then sipping from his pot and\r\n",
      "looking round at the company. He, too, appeared to be in some agitation.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was not used to crowds, and, as we said before, he avoided\r\n",
      "society of every sort, more especially of late. But now all at once he\r\n",
      "felt a desire to be with other people. Something new seemed to be taking\r\n",
      "place within him, and with it he felt a sort of thirst for company. He\r\n",
      "was so weary after a whole month of concentrated wretchedness and gloomy\r\n",
      "excitement that he longed to rest, if only for a moment, in some other\r\n",
      "world, whatever it might be; and, in spite of the filthiness of the\r\n",
      "surroundings, he was glad now to stay in the tavern.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The master of the establishment was in another room, but he frequently\r\n",
      "came down some steps into the main room, his jaunty, tarred boots with\r\n",
      "red turn-over tops coming into view each time before the rest of his\r\n",
      "person. He wore a full coat and a horribly greasy black satin waistcoat,\r\n",
      "with no cravat, and his whole face seemed smeared with oil like an\r\n",
      "iron lock. At the counter stood a boy of about fourteen, and there was\r\n",
      "another boy somewhat younger who handed whatever was wanted. On the\r\n",
      "counter lay some sliced cucumber, some pieces of dried black bread, and\r\n",
      "some fish, chopped up small, all smelling very bad. It was insufferably\r\n",
      "close, and so heavy with the fumes of spirits that five minutes in such\r\n",
      "an atmosphere might well make a man drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There are chance meetings with strangers that interest us from the\r\n",
      "first moment, before a word is spoken. Such was the impression made on\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov by the person sitting a little distance from him, who looked\r\n",
      "like a retired clerk. The young man often recalled this impression\r\n",
      "afterwards, and even ascribed it to presentiment. He looked repeatedly\r\n",
      "at the clerk, partly no doubt because the latter was staring\r\n",
      "persistently at him, obviously anxious to enter into conversation. At\r\n",
      "the other persons in the room, including the tavern-keeper, the clerk\r\n",
      "looked as though he were used to their company, and weary of it, showing\r\n",
      "a shade of condescending contempt for them as persons of station and\r\n",
      "culture inferior to his own, with whom it would be useless for him to\r\n",
      "converse. He was a man over fifty, bald and grizzled, of medium height,\r\n",
      "and stoutly built. His face, bloated from continual drinking, was of\r\n",
      "a yellow, even greenish, tinge, with swollen eyelids out of which keen\r\n",
      "reddish eyes gleamed like little chinks. But there was something very\r\n",
      "strange in him; there was a light in his eyes as though of intense\r\n",
      "feeling--perhaps there were even thought and intelligence, but at the\r\n",
      "same time there was a gleam of something like madness. He was wearing an\r\n",
      "old and hopelessly ragged black dress coat, with all its buttons missing\r\n",
      "except one, and that one he had buttoned, evidently clinging to this\r\n",
      "last trace of respectability. A crumpled shirt front, covered with spots\r\n",
      "and stains, protruded from his canvas waistcoat. Like a clerk, he wore\r\n",
      "no beard, nor moustache, but had been so long unshaven that his chin\r\n",
      "looked like a stiff greyish brush. And there was something respectable\r\n",
      "and like an official about his manner too. But he was restless; he\r\n",
      "ruffled up his hair and from time to time let his head drop into his\r\n",
      "hands dejectedly resting his ragged elbows on the stained and sticky\r\n",
      "table. At last he looked straight at Raskolnikov, and said loudly and\r\n",
      "resolutely:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“May I venture, honoured sir, to engage you in polite conversation?\r\n",
      "Forasmuch as, though your exterior would not command respect, my\r\n",
      "experience admonishes me that you are a man of education and not\r\n",
      "accustomed to drinking. I have always respected education when in\r\n",
      "conjunction with genuine sentiments, and I am besides a titular\r\n",
      "counsellor in rank. Marmeladov--such is my name; titular counsellor. I\r\n",
      "make bold to inquire--have you been in the service?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I am studying,” answered the young man, somewhat surprised at\r\n",
      "the grandiloquent style of the speaker and also at being so directly\r\n",
      "addressed. In spite of the momentary desire he had just been feeling for\r\n",
      "company of any sort, on being actually spoken to he felt immediately his\r\n",
      "habitual irritable and uneasy aversion for any stranger who approached\r\n",
      "or attempted to approach him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A student then, or formerly a student,” cried the clerk. “Just what\r\n",
      "I thought! I’m a man of experience, immense experience, sir,” and he\r\n",
      "tapped his forehead with his fingers in self-approval. “You’ve been a\r\n",
      "student or have attended some learned institution!... But allow me....”\r\n",
      " He got up, staggered, took up his jug and glass, and sat down beside\r\n",
      "the young man, facing him a little sideways. He was drunk, but spoke\r\n",
      "fluently and boldly, only occasionally losing the thread of his\r\n",
      "sentences and drawling his words. He pounced upon Raskolnikov as\r\n",
      "greedily as though he too had not spoken to a soul for a month.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Honoured sir,” he began almost with solemnity, “poverty is not a vice,\r\n",
      "that’s a true saying. Yet I know too that drunkenness is not a virtue,\r\n",
      "and that that’s even truer. But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a\r\n",
      "vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but\r\n",
      "in beggary--never--no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human\r\n",
      "society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as\r\n",
      "humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary\r\n",
      "I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house!\r\n",
      "Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and\r\n",
      "my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me\r\n",
      "to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent\r\n",
      "a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I have not happened to,” answered Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, I’ve just come from one and it’s the fifth night I’ve slept\r\n",
      "so....” He filled his glass, emptied it and paused. Bits of hay were in\r\n",
      "fact clinging to his clothes and sticking to his hair. It seemed quite\r\n",
      "probable that he had not undressed or washed for the last five days.\r\n",
      "His hands, particularly, were filthy. They were fat and red, with black\r\n",
      "nails.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His conversation seemed to excite a general though languid interest. The\r\n",
      "boys at the counter fell to sniggering. The innkeeper came down from the\r\n",
      "upper room, apparently on purpose to listen to the “funny fellow”\r\n",
      " and sat down at a little distance, yawning lazily, but with dignity.\r\n",
      "Evidently Marmeladov was a familiar figure here, and he had most\r\n",
      "likely acquired his weakness for high-flown speeches from the habit of\r\n",
      "frequently entering into conversation with strangers of all sorts in\r\n",
      "the tavern. This habit develops into a necessity in some drunkards, and\r\n",
      "especially in those who are looked after sharply and kept in order\r\n",
      "at home. Hence in the company of other drinkers they try to justify\r\n",
      "themselves and even if possible obtain consideration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Funny fellow!” pronounced the innkeeper. “And why don’t you work, why\r\n",
      "aren’t you at your duty, if you are in the service?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why am I not at my duty, honoured sir,” Marmeladov went on, addressing\r\n",
      "himself exclusively to Raskolnikov, as though it had been he who put\r\n",
      "that question to him. “Why am I not at my duty? Does not my heart ache\r\n",
      "to think what a useless worm I am? A month ago when Mr. Lebeziatnikov\r\n",
      "beat my wife with his own hands, and I lay drunk, didn’t I suffer?\r\n",
      "Excuse me, young man, has it ever happened to you... hm... well, to\r\n",
      "petition hopelessly for a loan?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, it has. But what do you mean by hopelessly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hopelessly in the fullest sense, when you know beforehand that you\r\n",
      "will get nothing by it. You know, for instance, beforehand with positive\r\n",
      "certainty that this man, this most reputable and exemplary citizen, will\r\n",
      "on no consideration give you money; and indeed I ask you why should he?\r\n",
      "For he knows of course that I shan’t pay it back. From compassion? But\r\n",
      "Mr. Lebeziatnikov who keeps up with modern ideas explained the other day\r\n",
      "that compassion is forbidden nowadays by science itself, and that that’s\r\n",
      "what is done now in England, where there is political economy. Why, I\r\n",
      "ask you, should he give it to me? And yet though I know beforehand that\r\n",
      "he won’t, I set off to him and...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you go?” put in Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, when one has no one, nowhere else one can go! For every man must\r\n",
      "have somewhere to go. Since there are times when one absolutely must\r\n",
      "go somewhere! When my own daughter first went out with a yellow ticket,\r\n",
      "then I had to go... (for my daughter has a yellow passport),” he added\r\n",
      "in parenthesis, looking with a certain uneasiness at the young man.\r\n",
      "“No matter, sir, no matter!” he went on hurriedly and with apparent\r\n",
      "composure when both the boys at the counter guffawed and even the\r\n",
      "innkeeper smiled--“No matter, I am not confounded by the wagging of\r\n",
      "their heads; for everyone knows everything about it already, and all\r\n",
      "that is secret is made open. And I accept it all, not with contempt, but\r\n",
      "with humility. So be it! So be it! ‘Behold the man!’ Excuse me, young\r\n",
      "man, can you.... No, to put it more strongly and more distinctly; not\r\n",
      "_can_ you but _dare_ you, looking upon me, assert that I am not a pig?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man did not answer a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well,” the orator began again stolidly and with even increased dignity,\r\n",
      "after waiting for the laughter in the room to subside. “Well, so be\r\n",
      "it, I am a pig, but she is a lady! I have the semblance of a beast, but\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna, my spouse, is a person of education and an officer’s\r\n",
      "daughter. Granted, granted, I am a scoundrel, but she is a woman of a\r\n",
      "noble heart, full of sentiments, refined by education. And yet... oh,\r\n",
      "if only she felt for me! Honoured sir, honoured sir, you know every man\r\n",
      "ought to have at least one place where people feel for him! But Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, though she is magnanimous, she is unjust.... And yet, although\r\n",
      "I realise that when she pulls my hair she only does it out of pity--for\r\n",
      "I repeat without being ashamed, she pulls my hair, young man,” he\r\n",
      "declared with redoubled dignity, hearing the sniggering again--“but, my\r\n",
      "God, if she would but once.... But no, no! It’s all in vain and it’s no\r\n",
      "use talking! No use talking! For more than once, my wish did come true\r\n",
      "and more than once she has felt for me but... such is my fate and I am a\r\n",
      "beast by nature!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rather!” assented the innkeeper yawning. Marmeladov struck his fist\r\n",
      "resolutely on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Such is my fate! Do you know, sir, do you know, I have sold her very\r\n",
      "stockings for drink? Not her shoes--that would be more or less in the\r\n",
      "order of things, but her stockings, her stockings I have sold for drink!\r\n",
      "Her mohair shawl I sold for drink, a present to her long ago, her own\r\n",
      "property, not mine; and we live in a cold room and she caught cold this\r\n",
      "winter and has begun coughing and spitting blood too. We have three\r\n",
      "little children and Katerina Ivanovna is at work from morning till\r\n",
      "night; she is scrubbing and cleaning and washing the children, for she’s\r\n",
      "been used to cleanliness from a child. But her chest is weak and she has\r\n",
      "a tendency to consumption and I feel it! Do you suppose I don’t feel it?\r\n",
      "And the more I drink the more I feel it. That’s why I drink too. I try\r\n",
      "to find sympathy and feeling in drink.... I drink so that I may suffer\r\n",
      "twice as much!” And as though in despair he laid his head down on the\r\n",
      "table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Young man,” he went on, raising his head again, “in your face I seem to\r\n",
      "read some trouble of mind. When you came in I read it, and that was why\r\n",
      "I addressed you at once. For in unfolding to you the story of my life, I\r\n",
      "do not wish to make myself a laughing-stock before these idle listeners,\r\n",
      "who indeed know all about it already, but I am looking for a man\r\n",
      "of feeling and education. Know then that my wife was educated in a\r\n",
      "high-class school for the daughters of noblemen, and on leaving she\r\n",
      "danced the shawl dance before the governor and other personages for\r\n",
      "which she was presented with a gold medal and a certificate of merit.\r\n",
      "The medal... well, the medal of course was sold--long ago, hm... but the\r\n",
      "certificate of merit is in her trunk still and not long ago she showed\r\n",
      "it to our landlady. And although she is most continually on bad terms\r\n",
      "with the landlady, yet she wanted to tell someone or other of her past\r\n",
      "honours and of the happy days that are gone. I don’t condemn her for\r\n",
      "it, I don’t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of\r\n",
      "the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady\r\n",
      "of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has\r\n",
      "nothing but black bread to eat, but won’t allow herself to be treated\r\n",
      "with disrespect. That’s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov’s\r\n",
      "rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to\r\n",
      "her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was\r\n",
      "a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the\r\n",
      "other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and\r\n",
      "ran away with him from her father’s house. She was exceedingly fond of\r\n",
      "her husband; but he gave way to cards, got into trouble and with that he\r\n",
      "died. He used to beat her at the end: and although she paid him back, of\r\n",
      "which I have authentic documentary evidence, to this day she speaks of\r\n",
      "him with tears and she throws him up to me; and I am glad, I am glad\r\n",
      "that, though only in imagination, she should think of herself as having\r\n",
      "once been happy.... And she was left at his death with three children in\r\n",
      "a wild and remote district where I happened to be at the time; and she\r\n",
      "was left in such hopeless poverty that, although I have seen many ups\r\n",
      "and downs of all sort, I don’t feel equal to describing it even. Her\r\n",
      "relations had all thrown her off. And she was proud, too, excessively\r\n",
      "proud.... And then, honoured sir, and then, I, being at the time a\r\n",
      "widower, with a daughter of fourteen left me by my first wife, offered\r\n",
      "her my hand, for I could not bear the sight of such suffering. You can\r\n",
      "judge the extremity of her calamities, that she, a woman of education\r\n",
      "and culture and distinguished family, should have consented to be my\r\n",
      "wife. But she did! Weeping and sobbing and wringing her hands, she\r\n",
      "married me! For she had nowhere to turn! Do you understand, sir, do you\r\n",
      "understand what it means when you have absolutely nowhere to turn? No,\r\n",
      "that you don’t understand yet.... And for a whole year, I performed\r\n",
      "my duties conscientiously and faithfully, and did not touch this” (he\r\n",
      "tapped the jug with his finger), “for I have feelings. But even so, I\r\n",
      "could not please her; and then I lost my place too, and that through no\r\n",
      "fault of mine but through changes in the office; and then I did touch\r\n",
      "it!... It will be a year and a half ago soon since we found ourselves at\r\n",
      "last after many wanderings and numerous calamities in this magnificent\r\n",
      "capital, adorned with innumerable monuments. Here I obtained a\r\n",
      "situation.... I obtained it and I lost it again. Do you understand? This\r\n",
      "time it was through my own fault I lost it: for my weakness had come\r\n",
      "out.... We have now part of a room at Amalia Fyodorovna Lippevechsel’s;\r\n",
      "and what we live upon and what we pay our rent with, I could not say.\r\n",
      "There are a lot of people living there besides ourselves. Dirt and\r\n",
      "disorder, a perfect Bedlam... hm... yes... And meanwhile my daughter by\r\n",
      "my first wife has grown up; and what my daughter has had to put up with\r\n",
      "from her step-mother whilst she was growing up, I won’t speak of. For,\r\n",
      "though Katerina Ivanovna is full of generous feelings, she is a spirited\r\n",
      "lady, irritable and short-tempered.... Yes. But it’s no use going over\r\n",
      "that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an\r\n",
      "effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal\r\n",
      "history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we\r\n",
      "had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not\r\n",
      "even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at\r\n",
      "Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read\r\n",
      "other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great\r\n",
      "interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes’ Physiology--do\r\n",
      "you know it?--and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that’s the\r\n",
      "whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured\r\n",
      "sir, on my own account with a private question. Do you suppose that\r\n",
      "a respectable poor girl can earn much by honest work? Not fifteen\r\n",
      "farthings a day can she earn, if she is respectable and has no special\r\n",
      "talent and that without putting her work down for an instant! And what’s\r\n",
      "more, Ivan Ivanitch Klopstock the civil counsellor--have you heard of\r\n",
      "him?--has not to this day paid her for the half-dozen linen shirts she\r\n",
      "made him and drove her roughly away, stamping and reviling her, on the\r\n",
      "pretext that the shirt collars were not made like the pattern and were\r\n",
      "put in askew. And there are the little ones hungry.... And Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna walking up and down and wringing her hands, her cheeks flushed\r\n",
      "red, as they always are in that disease: ‘Here you live with us,’ says\r\n",
      "she, ‘you eat and drink and are kept warm and you do nothing to help.’\r\n",
      "And much she gets to eat and drink when there is not a crust for the\r\n",
      "little ones for three days! I was lying at the time... well, what of\r\n",
      "it! I was lying drunk and I heard my Sonia speaking (she is a gentle\r\n",
      "creature with a soft little voice... fair hair and such a pale, thin\r\n",
      "little face). She said: ‘Katerina Ivanovna, am I really to do a thing\r\n",
      "like that?’ And Darya Frantsovna, a woman of evil character and very\r\n",
      "well known to the police, had two or three times tried to get at her\r\n",
      "through the landlady. ‘And why not?’ said Katerina Ivanovna with a jeer,\r\n",
      "‘you are something mighty precious to be so careful of!’ But don’t blame\r\n",
      "her, don’t blame her, honoured sir, don’t blame her! She was not herself\r\n",
      "when she spoke, but driven to distraction by her illness and the crying\r\n",
      "of the hungry children; and it was said more to wound her than anything\r\n",
      "else.... For that’s Katerina Ivanovna’s character, and when children\r\n",
      "cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o’clock\r\n",
      "I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the\r\n",
      "room and about nine o’clock she came back. She walked straight up to\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her\r\n",
      "in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she\r\n",
      "simply picked up our big green _drap de dames_ shawl (we have a shawl,\r\n",
      "made of _drap de dames_), put it over her head and face and lay down\r\n",
      "on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her\r\n",
      "body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....\r\n",
      "And then I saw, young man, I saw Katerina Ivanovna, in the same silence\r\n",
      "go up to Sonia’s little bed; she was on her knees all the evening\r\n",
      "kissing Sonia’s feet, and would not get up, and then they both fell\r\n",
      "asleep in each other’s arms... together, together... yes... and I... lay\r\n",
      "drunk.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov stopped short, as though his voice had failed him. Then he\r\n",
      "hurriedly filled his glass, drank, and cleared his throat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Since then, sir,” he went on after a brief pause--“Since then, owing\r\n",
      "to an unfortunate occurrence and through information given by\r\n",
      "evil-intentioned persons--in all which Darya Frantsovna took a\r\n",
      "leading part on the pretext that she had been treated with want of\r\n",
      "respect--since then my daughter Sofya Semyonovna has been forced to take\r\n",
      "a yellow ticket, and owing to that she is unable to go on living with\r\n",
      "us. For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though\r\n",
      "she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too...\r\n",
      "hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia’s\r\n",
      "account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of\r\n",
      "a sudden he stood on his dignity: ‘how,’ said he, ‘can a highly educated\r\n",
      "man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?’ And Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that’s\r\n",
      "how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she\r\n",
      "comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room\r\n",
      "at the Kapernaumovs’ the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is\r\n",
      "a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft\r\n",
      "palates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate. They all live in one\r\n",
      "room, but Sonia has her own, partitioned off.... Hm... yes... very poor\r\n",
      "people and all with cleft palates... yes. Then I got up in the morning,\r\n",
      "and put on my rags, lifted up my hands to heaven and set off to his\r\n",
      "excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch. His excellency Ivan Afanasyvitch, do you\r\n",
      "know him? No? Well, then, it’s a man of God you don’t know. He is wax...\r\n",
      "wax before the face of the Lord; even as wax melteth!... His eyes were\r\n",
      "dim when he heard my story. ‘Marmeladov, once already you have\r\n",
      "deceived my expectations... I’ll take you once more on my own\r\n",
      "responsibility’--that’s what he said, ‘remember,’ he said, ‘and now you\r\n",
      "can go.’ I kissed the dust at his feet--in thought only, for in reality\r\n",
      "he would not have allowed me to do it, being a statesman and a man of\r\n",
      "modern political and enlightened ideas. I returned home, and when I\r\n",
      "announced that I’d been taken back into the service and should receive a\r\n",
      "salary, heavens, what a to-do there was!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov stopped again in violent excitement. At that moment a whole\r\n",
      "party of revellers already drunk came in from the street, and the sounds\r\n",
      "of a hired concertina and the cracked piping voice of a child of seven\r\n",
      "singing “The Hamlet” were heard in the entry. The room was filled with\r\n",
      "noise. The tavern-keeper and the boys were busy with the new-comers.\r\n",
      "Marmeladov paying no attention to the new arrivals continued his story.\r\n",
      "He appeared by now to be extremely weak, but as he became more and more\r\n",
      "drunk, he became more and more talkative. The recollection of his\r\n",
      "recent success in getting the situation seemed to revive him, and was\r\n",
      "positively reflected in a sort of radiance on his face. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "listened attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was five weeks ago, sir. Yes.... As soon as Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "and Sonia heard of it, mercy on us, it was as though I stepped into the\r\n",
      "kingdom of Heaven. It used to be: you can lie like a beast, nothing but\r\n",
      "abuse. Now they were walking on tiptoe, hushing the children. ‘Semyon\r\n",
      "Zaharovitch is tired with his work at the office, he is resting, shh!’\r\n",
      "They made me coffee before I went to work and boiled cream for me! They\r\n",
      "began to get real cream for me, do you hear that? And how they managed\r\n",
      "to get together the money for a decent outfit--eleven roubles, fifty\r\n",
      "copecks, I can’t guess. Boots, cotton shirt-fronts--most magnificent,\r\n",
      "a uniform, they got up all in splendid style, for eleven roubles and\r\n",
      "a half. The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner--soup and salt meat with\r\n",
      "horse radish--which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any\r\n",
      "dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going\r\n",
      "on a visit; and not that she’d anything to do it with, she smartened\r\n",
      "herself up with nothing at all, she’d done her hair nicely, put on a\r\n",
      "clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different\r\n",
      "person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling,\r\n",
      "had only helped with money ‘for the time,’ she said, ‘it won’t do for me\r\n",
      "to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.’ Do\r\n",
      "you hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you\r\n",
      "think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with\r\n",
      "our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not\r\n",
      "resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting,\r\n",
      "whispering together. ‘Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,\r\n",
      "now, and receiving a salary,’ says she, ‘and he went himself to his\r\n",
      "excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the\r\n",
      "others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into\r\n",
      "his study.’ Do you hear, do you hear? ‘To be sure,’ says he, ‘Semyon\r\n",
      "Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,’ says he, ‘and in spite\r\n",
      "of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and\r\n",
      "since moreover we’ve got on badly without you,’ (do you hear, do you\r\n",
      "hear;) ‘and so,’ says he, ‘I rely now on your word as a gentleman.’ And\r\n",
      "all that, let me tell you, she has simply made up for herself, and not\r\n",
      "simply out of wantonness, for the sake of bragging; no, she believes it\r\n",
      "all herself, she amuses herself with her own fancies, upon my word she\r\n",
      "does! And I don’t blame her for it, no, I don’t blame her!... Six days\r\n",
      "ago when I brought her my first earnings in full--twenty-three roubles\r\n",
      "forty copecks altogether--she called me her poppet: ‘poppet,’ said she,\r\n",
      "‘my little poppet.’ And when we were by ourselves, you understand?\r\n",
      "You would not think me a beauty, you would not think much of me as a\r\n",
      "husband, would you?... Well, she pinched my cheek, ‘my little poppet,’\r\n",
      "said she.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov broke off, tried to smile, but suddenly his chin began\r\n",
      "to twitch. He controlled himself however. The tavern, the degraded\r\n",
      "appearance of the man, the five nights in the hay barge, and the pot of\r\n",
      "spirits, and yet this poignant love for his wife and children bewildered\r\n",
      "his listener. Raskolnikov listened intently but with a sick sensation.\r\n",
      "He felt vexed that he had come here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "others, and perhaps I am only worrying you with the stupidity of all the\r\n",
      "trivial details of my home life, but it is not a laughing matter to me.\r\n",
      "For I can feel it all.... And the whole of that heavenly day of my life\r\n",
      "and the whole of that evening I passed in fleeting dreams of how I would\r\n",
      "arrange it all, and how I would dress all the children, and how I should\r\n",
      "give her rest, and how I should rescue my own daughter from dishonour\r\n",
      "and restore her to the bosom of her family.... And a great deal more....\r\n",
      "Quite excusable, sir. Well, then, sir” (Marmeladov suddenly gave a sort\r\n",
      "of start, raised his head and gazed intently at his listener) “well, on\r\n",
      "the very next day after all those dreams, that is to say, exactly five\r\n",
      "days ago, in the evening, by a cunning trick, like a thief in the night,\r\n",
      "I stole from Katerina Ivanovna the key of her box, took out what was\r\n",

      "later his face suddenly changed and with a certain assumed slyness and\r\n",
      "affectation of bravado, he glanced at Raskolnikov, laughed and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This morning I went to see Sonia, I went to ask her for a pick-me-up!\r\n",
      "He-he-he!”\r\n",

      "“You don’t say she gave it to you?” cried one of the new-comers; he\r\n",
      "shouted the words and went off into a guffaw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This very quart was bought with her money,” Marmeladov declared,\r\n",
      "addressing himself exclusively to Raskolnikov. “Thirty copecks she gave\r\n",
      "me with her own hands, her last, all she had, as I saw.... She said\r\n",
      "nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up\r\n",
      "yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don’t blame them,\r\n",
      "they don’t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don’t\r\n",
      "blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do\r\n",
      "you think, my dear sir? For now she’s got to keep up her appearance. It\r\n",
      "costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you\r\n",
      "understand? And there’s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things;\r\n",
      "petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her\r\n",
      "foot when she has to step over a puddle. Do you understand, sir, do you\r\n",
      "understand what all that smartness means? And here I, her own father,\r\n",
      "here I took thirty copecks of that money for a drink! And I am drinking\r\n",
      "it! And I have already drunk it! Come, who will have pity on a man like\r\n",
      "me, eh? Are you sorry for me, sir, or not? Tell me, sir, are you sorry\r\n",
      "or not? He-he-he!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He would have filled his glass, but there was no drink left. The pot was\r\n",
      "empty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you to be pitied for?” shouted the tavern-keeper who was again\r\n",
      "near them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shouts of laughter and even oaths followed. The laughter and the oaths\r\n",
      "came from those who were listening and also from those who had heard\r\n",
      "nothing but were simply looking at the figure of the discharged\r\n",
      "government clerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To be pitied! Why am I to be pitied?” Marmeladov suddenly declaimed,\r\n",
      "standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only\r\n",
      "waiting for that question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there’s nothing to pity me for! I\r\n",
      "ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me,\r\n",
      "oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be\r\n",
      "crucified, for it’s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!...\r\n",
      "Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been\r\n",
      "sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and\r\n",
      "tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity\r\n",
      "us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all\r\n",
      "things, He is the One, He too is the judge. He will come in that day\r\n",
      "and He will ask: ‘Where is the daughter who gave herself for her cross,\r\n",
      "consumptive step-mother and for the little children of another? Where is\r\n",
      "the daughter who had pity upon the filthy drunkard, her earthly father,\r\n",
      "undismayed by his beastliness?’ And He will say, ‘Come to me! I have\r\n",
      "already forgiven thee once.... I have forgiven thee once.... Thy sins\r\n",
      "which are many are forgiven thee for thou hast loved much....’ And he\r\n",
      "will forgive my Sonia, He will forgive, I know it... I felt it in my\r\n",
      "heart when I was with her just now! And He will judge and will forgive\r\n",
      "all, the good and the evil, the wise and the meek.... And when He has\r\n",
      "done with all of them, then He will summon us. ‘You too come forth,’\r\n",
      "He will say, ‘Come forth ye drunkards, come forth, ye weak ones, come\r\n",
      "forth, ye children of shame!’ And we shall all come forth, without shame\r\n",
      "and shall stand before him. And He will say unto us, ‘Ye are swine, made\r\n",
      "in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!’ And the\r\n",
      "wise ones and those of understanding will say, ‘Oh Lord, why dost Thou\r\n",
      "receive these men?’ And He will say, ‘This is why I receive them, oh ye\r\n",
      "wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one\r\n",
      "of them believed himself to be worthy of this.’ And He will hold out His\r\n",
      "hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep...\r\n",
      "and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and\r\n",
      "all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....\r\n",
      "Lord, Thy kingdom come!” And he sank down on the bench exhausted, and\r\n",
      "helpless, looking at no one, apparently oblivious of his surroundings\r\n",
      "and plunged in deep thought. His words had created a certain impression;\r\n",
      "there was a moment of silence; but soon laughter and oaths were heard\r\n",
      "again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s his notion!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“A fine clerk he is!”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Let us go, sir,” said Marmeladov all at once, raising his head and\r\n",
      "addressing Raskolnikov--“come along with me... Kozel’s house, looking\r\n",
      "into the yard. I’m going to Katerina Ivanovna--time I did.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had for some time been wanting to go and he had meant to\r\n",
      "help him. Marmeladov was much unsteadier on his legs than in his speech\r\n",
      "and leaned heavily on the young man. They had two or three hundred\r\n",
      "paces to go. The drunken man was more and more overcome by dismay and\r\n",
      "confusion as they drew nearer the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not Katerina Ivanovna I am afraid of now,” he muttered in\r\n",
      "agitation--“and that she will begin pulling my hair. What does my hair\r\n",
      "matter! Bother my hair! That’s what I say! Indeed it will be better if\r\n",
      "she does begin pulling it, that’s not what I am afraid of... it’s her\r\n",
      "eyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too,\r\n",
      "frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people\r\n",
      "in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of\r\n",
      "the children’s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food...\r\n",
      "I don’t know what’s happened! I don’t know! But blows I am not afraid\r\n",
      "of.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an\r\n",
      "enjoyment. In fact I can’t get on without it.... It’s better so. Let\r\n",
      "her strike me, it relieves her heart... it’s better so... There is the\r\n",
      "house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do.\r\n",
      "Lead the way!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They went in from the yard and up to the fourth storey. The staircase\r\n",
      "got darker and darker as they went up. It was nearly eleven o’clock\r\n",
      "and although in summer in Petersburg there is no real night, yet it was\r\n",
      "quite dark at the top of the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A grimy little door at the very top of the stairs stood ajar. A very\r\n",
      "poor-looking room about ten paces long was lighted up by a candle-end;\r\n",
      "the whole of it was visible from the entrance. It was all in disorder,\r\n",
      "littered up with rags of all sorts, especially children’s garments.\r\n",
      "Across the furthest corner was stretched a ragged sheet. Behind it\r\n",
      "probably was the bed. There was nothing in the room except two chairs\r\n",
      "and a sofa covered with American leather, full of holes, before which\r\n",
      "stood an old deal kitchen-table, unpainted and uncovered. At the edge\r\n",
      "of the table stood a smoldering tallow-candle in an iron candlestick. It\r\n",
      "appeared that the family had a room to themselves, not part of a room,\r\n",
      "but their room was practically a passage. The door leading to the other\r\n",
      "rooms, or rather cupboards, into which Amalia Lippevechsel’s flat was\r\n",
      "divided stood half open, and there was shouting, uproar and laughter\r\n",
      "within. People seemed to be playing cards and drinking tea there. Words\r\n",
      "of the most unceremonious kind flew out from time to time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov recognised Katerina Ivanovna at once. She was a rather tall,\r\n",
      "slim and graceful woman, terribly emaciated, with magnificent dark brown\r\n",
      "hair and with a hectic flush in her cheeks. She was pacing up and down\r\n",
      "in her little room, pressing her hands against her chest; her lips\r\n",
      "were parched and her breathing came in nervous broken gasps. Her eyes\r\n",
      "glittered as in fever and looked about with a harsh immovable stare. And\r\n",
      "that consumptive and excited face with the last flickering light of the\r\n",
      "candle-end playing upon it made a sickening impression. She seemed to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov about thirty years old and was certainly a strange wife for\r\n",
      "Marmeladov.... She had not heard them and did not notice them coming in.\r\n",
      "She seemed to be lost in thought, hearing and seeing nothing. The room\r\n",
      "was close, but she had not opened the window; a stench rose from the\r\n",
      "staircase, but the door on to the stairs was not closed. From the inner\r\n",
      "rooms clouds of tobacco smoke floated in, she kept coughing, but did not\r\n",
      "close the door. The youngest child, a girl of six, was asleep, sitting\r\n",
      "curled up on the floor with her head on the sofa. A boy a year older\r\n",
      "stood crying and shaking in the corner, probably he had just had a\r\n",
      "beating. Beside him stood a girl of nine years old, tall and thin,\r\n",
      "wearing a thin and ragged chemise with an ancient cashmere pelisse flung\r\n",
      "over her bare shoulders, long outgrown and barely reaching her knees.\r\n",
      "Her arm, as thin as a stick, was round her brother’s neck. She was\r\n",
      "trying to comfort him, whispering something to him, and doing all she\r\n",
      "could to keep him from whimpering again. At the same time her large\r\n",

      "face, were watching her mother with alarm. Marmeladov did not enter the\r\n",
      "door, but dropped on his knees in the very doorway, pushing Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "in front of him. The woman seeing a stranger stopped indifferently\r\n",
      "facing him, coming to herself for a moment and apparently wondering what\r\n",
      "he had come for. But evidently she decided that he was going into\r\n",
      "the next room, as he had to pass through hers to get there. Taking no\r\n",
      "further notice of him, she walked towards the outer door to close it\r\n",
      "and uttered a sudden scream on seeing her husband on his knees in the\r\n",
      "doorway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah!” she cried out in a frenzy, “he has come back! The criminal! the\r\n",

      "your clothes are all different! Where are your clothes? Where is the\r\n",
      "money! Speak!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And she fell to searching him. Marmeladov submissively and obediently\r\n",
      "held up both arms to facilitate the search. Not a farthing was there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where is the money?” she cried--“Mercy on us, can he have drunk it all?\r\n",
      "There were twelve silver roubles left in the chest!” and in a fury\r\n",
      "she seized him by the hair and dragged him into the room. Marmeladov\r\n",
      "seconded her efforts by meekly crawling along on his knees.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And this is a consolation to me! This does not hurt me, but is a\r\n",
      "positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,” he called out, shaken to and\r\n",
      "fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead.\r\n",
      "The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the\r\n",
      "corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed\r\n",
      "to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was\r\n",
      "shaking like a leaf.\r\n",

      "wringing her hands she pointed to the children. “Oh, accursed life!\r\n",
      "And you, are you not ashamed?”--she pounced all at once upon\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov--“from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have\r\n",

      "The young man was hastening away without uttering a word. The inner door\r\n",
      "was thrown wide open and inquisitive faces were peering in at it. Coarse\r\n",

      "themselves in at the doorway. Further in could be seen figures in\r\n",
      "dressing gowns flung open, in costumes of unseemly scantiness, some of\r\n",
      "them with cards in their hands. They were particularly diverted, when\r\n",
      "Marmeladov, dragged about by his hair, shouted that it was a consolation\r\n",
      "to him. They even began to come into the room; at last a sinister shrill\r\n",
      "outcry was heard: this came from Amalia Lippevechsel herself pushing her\r\n",
      "way amongst them and trying to restore order after her own fashion and\r\n",
      "for the hundredth time to frighten the poor woman by ordering her\r\n",
      "with coarse abuse to clear out of the room next day. As he went out,\r\n",

      "coppers he had received in exchange for his rouble in the tavern and to\r\n",

      "dismissed it with a wave of his hand and went back to his lodging.\r\n",

      "laughed malignantly--“such smartness costs money.... Hm! And maybe Sonia\r\n",
      "herself will be bankrupt to-day, for there is always a risk, hunting\r\n",
      "big game... digging for gold... then they would all be without a crust\r\n",
      "to-morrow except for my money. Hurrah for Sonia! What a mine they’ve dug\r\n",

      "He waked up late next day after a broken sleep. But his sleep had not\r\n",
      "refreshed him; he waked up bilious, irritable, ill-tempered, and looked\r\n",
      "with hatred at his room. It was a tiny cupboard of a room about six\r\n",
      "paces in length. It had a poverty-stricken appearance with its dusty\r\n",
      "yellow paper peeling off the walls, and it was so low-pitched that a man\r\n",
      "of more than average height was ill at ease in it and felt every moment\r\n",
      "that he would knock his head against the ceiling. The furniture was in\r\n",
      "keeping with the room: there were three old chairs, rather rickety; a\r\n",
      "painted table in the corner on which lay a few manuscripts and books;\r\n",
      "the dust that lay thick upon them showed that they had been long\r\n",
      "untouched. A big clumsy sofa occupied almost the whole of one wall and\r\n",
      "half the floor space of the room; it was once covered with chintz, but\r\n",
      "was now in rags and served Raskolnikov as a bed. Often he went to sleep\r\n",
      "on it, as he was, without undressing, without sheets, wrapped in his old\r\n",
      "student’s overcoat, with his head on one little pillow, under which he\r\n",
      "heaped up all the linen he had, clean and dirty, by way of a bolster. A\r\n",
      "little table stood in front of the sofa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It would have been difficult to sink to a lower ebb of disorder, but to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov in his present state of mind this was positively agreeable.\r\n",
      "He had got completely away from everyone, like a tortoise in its shell,\r\n",
      "and even the sight of a servant girl who had to wait upon him and looked\r\n",
      "sometimes into his room made him writhe with nervous irritation. He was\r\n",
      "in the condition that overtakes some monomaniacs entirely concentrated\r\n",
      "upon one thing. His landlady had for the last fortnight given up sending\r\n",
      "him in meals, and he had not yet thought of expostulating with her,\r\n",
      "though he went without his dinner. Nastasya, the cook and only servant,\r\n",
      "was rather pleased at the lodger’s mood and had entirely given up\r\n",
      "sweeping and doing his room, only once a week or so she would stray into\r\n",
      "his room with a broom. She waked him up that day.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Here, Nastasya, take it please,” he said, fumbling in his pocket (for\r\n",
      "he had slept in his clothes) and taking out a handful of coppers--“run\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya\r\n",

      "“Fool she is and no mistake, just as I am. But why, if you are so\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya was overcome with a fit of laughter. She was given to laughter\r\n",
      "and when anything amused her, she laughed inaudibly, quivering and\r\n",
      "shaking all over till she felt ill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And have you made much money by your thinking?” she managed to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A minute later the letter was brought him. That was it: from his mother,\r\n",

      "long while since he had received a letter, but another feeling also\r\n",
      "suddenly stabbed his heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "The letter was quivering in his hand; he did not want to open it in her\r\n",

      "had gone out, he lifted it quickly to his lips and kissed it; then he\r\n",
      "gazed intently at the address, the small, sloping handwriting, so dear\r\n",
      "and familiar, of the mother who had once taught him to read and write.\r\n",
      "He delayed; he seemed almost afraid of something. At last he opened it;\r\n",

      "awake at night, thinking. But I am sure you will not blame me for my\r\n",
      "inevitable silence. You know how I love you; you are all we have to look\r\n",
      "to, Dounia and I, you are our all, our one hope, our one stay. What a\r\n",
      "grief it was to me when I heard that you had given up the university\r\n",
      "some months ago, for want of means to keep yourself and that you had\r\n",
      "lost your lessons and your other work! How could I help you out of my\r\n",
      "hundred and twenty roubles a year pension? The fifteen roubles I sent\r\n",
      "you four months ago I borrowed, as you know, on security of my pension,\r\n",
      "from Vassily Ivanovitch Vahrushin a merchant of this town. He is a\r\n",
      "kind-hearted man and was a friend of your father’s too. But having given\r\n",
      "him the right to receive the pension, I had to wait till the debt was\r\n",
      "paid off and that is only just done, so that I’ve been unable to send\r\n",
      "you anything all this time. But now, thank God, I believe I shall\r\n",
      "be able to send you something more and in fact we may congratulate\r\n",
      "ourselves on our good fortune now, of which I hasten to inform you. In\r\n",
      "the first place, would you have guessed, dear Rodya, that your sister\r\n",
      "has been living with me for the last six weeks and we shall not be\r\n",
      "separated in the future. Thank God, her sufferings are over, but I will\r\n",
      "tell you everything in order, so that you may know just how everything\r\n",
      "has happened and all that we have hitherto concealed from you. When you\r\n",
      "wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great\r\n",
      "deal to put up with in the Svidrigaïlovs’ house, when you wrote that\r\n",
      "and asked me to tell you all about it--what could I write in answer to\r\n",
      "you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have\r\n",
      "thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all\r\n",
      "the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not\r\n",
      "let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I\r\n",
      "do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What\r\n",
      "made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles\r\n",
      "in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on\r\n",
      "condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it\r\n",
      "was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.\r\n",
      "This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took\r\n",
      "chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly\r\n",
      "then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then,\r\n",
      "writing that this money came from Dounia’s savings, but that was not\r\n",
      "so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have\r\n",
      "suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves\r\n",
      "you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidrigaïlov treated\r\n",
      "her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at\r\n",
      "table.... But I don’t want to go into all those painful details, so as\r\n",
      "not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over. In short, in spite\r\n",
      "of the kind and generous behaviour of Marfa Petrovna, Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s\r\n",
      "wife, and all the rest of the household, Dounia had a very hard time,\r\n",
      "especially when Mr. Svidrigaïlov, relapsing into his old regimental\r\n",
      "habits, was under the influence of Bacchus. And how do you think it\r\n",
      "was all explained later on? Would you believe that the crazy fellow had\r\n",
      "conceived a passion for Dounia from the beginning, but had concealed\r\n",
      "it under a show of rudeness and contempt. Possibly he was ashamed and\r\n",
      "horrified himself at his own flighty hopes, considering his years and\r\n",
      "his being the father of a family; and that made him angry with Dounia.\r\n",
      "And possibly, too, he hoped by his rude and sneering behaviour to hide\r\n",
      "the truth from others. But at last he lost all control and had the face\r\n",
      "to make Dounia an open and shameful proposal, promising her all sorts of\r\n",
      "inducements and offering, besides, to throw up everything and take her\r\n",
      "to another estate of his, or even abroad. You can imagine all she went\r\n",
      "through! To leave her situation at once was impossible not only on\r\n",
      "account of the money debt, but also to spare the feelings of Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna, whose suspicions would have been aroused: and then Dounia\r\n",
      "would have been the cause of a rupture in the family. And it would\r\n",
      "have meant a terrible scandal for Dounia too; that would have been\r\n",
      "inevitable. There were various other reasons owing to which Dounia could\r\n",
      "not hope to escape from that awful house for another six weeks. You know\r\n",
      "Dounia, of course; you know how clever she is and what a strong will she\r\n",
      "has. Dounia can endure a great deal and even in the most difficult cases\r\n",
      "she has the fortitude to maintain her firmness. She did not even write\r\n",
      "to me about everything for fear of upsetting me, although we were\r\n",
      "constantly in communication. It all ended very unexpectedly. Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna accidentally overheard her husband imploring Dounia in the\r\n",
      "garden, and, putting quite a wrong interpretation on the position, threw\r\n",
      "the blame upon her, believing her to be the cause of it all. An awful\r\n",
      "scene took place between them on the spot in the garden; Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "went so far as to strike Dounia, refused to hear anything and was\r\n",
      "shouting at her for a whole hour and then gave orders that Dounia should\r\n",
      "be packed off at once to me in a plain peasant’s cart, into which they\r\n",
      "flung all her things, her linen and her clothes, all pell-mell, without\r\n",
      "folding it up and packing it. And a heavy shower of rain came on, too,\r\n",
      "and Dounia, insulted and put to shame, had to drive with a peasant in an\r\n",
      "open cart all the seventeen versts into town. Only think now what answer\r\n",
      "could I have sent to the letter I received from you two months ago and\r\n",
      "what could I have written? I was in despair; I dared not write to\r\n",
      "you the truth because you would have been very unhappy, mortified\r\n",
      "and indignant, and yet what could you do? You could only perhaps ruin\r\n",
      "yourself, and, besides, Dounia would not allow it; and fill up my letter\r\n",
      "with trifles when my heart was so full of sorrow, I could not. For a\r\n",
      "whole month the town was full of gossip about this scandal, and it came\r\n",
      "to such a pass that Dounia and I dared not even go to church on account\r\n",
      "of the contemptuous looks, whispers, and even remarks made aloud about\r\n",
      "us. All our acquaintances avoided us, nobody even bowed to us in the\r\n",
      "street, and I learnt that some shopmen and clerks were intending to\r\n",
      "insult us in a shameful way, smearing the gates of our house with pitch,\r\n",
      "so that the landlord began to tell us we must leave. All this was set\r\n",
      "going by Marfa Petrovna who managed to slander Dounia and throw dirt at\r\n",
      "her in every family. She knows everyone in the neighbourhood, and that\r\n",
      "month she was continually coming into the town, and as she is\r\n",
      "rather talkative and fond of gossiping about her family affairs and\r\n",
      "particularly of complaining to all and each of her husband--which is not\r\n",
      "at all right--so in a short time she had spread her story not only in\r\n",
      "the town, but over the whole surrounding district. It made me ill, but\r\n",

      "had been forced to write and give to him, before Marfa Petrovna\r\n",
      "came upon them in the garden. This letter, which remained in Mr.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov’s hands after her departure, she had written to refuse\r\n",
      "personal explanations and secret interviews, for which he was entreating\r\n",
      "her. In that letter she reproached him with great heat and indignation\r\n",
      "for the baseness of his behaviour in regard to Marfa Petrovna, reminding\r\n",
      "him that he was the father and head of a family and telling him how\r\n",

      "unhappy enough already. Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and\r\n",
      "touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot\r\n",
      "read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too,\r\n",
      "cleared Dounia’s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more\r\n",
      "than Mr. Svidrigaïlov had himself supposed--as indeed is always the case\r\n",
      "with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and ‘again\r\n",
      "crushed’ as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of\r\n",
      "Dounia’s innocence. The very next day, being Sunday, she went straight\r\n",
      "to the Cathedral, knelt down and prayed with tears to Our Lady to give\r\n",
      "her strength to bear this new trial and to do her duty. Then she\r\n",
      "came straight from the Cathedral to us, told us the whole story, wept\r\n",
      "bitterly and, fully penitent, she embraced Dounia and besought her to\r\n",
      "forgive her. The same morning without any delay, she went round to all\r\n",
      "the houses in the town and everywhere, shedding tears, she asserted in\r\n",
      "the most flattering terms Dounia’s innocence and the nobility of\r\n",
      "her feelings and her behavior. What was more, she showed and read to\r\n",
      "everyone the letter in Dounia’s own handwriting to Mr. Svidrigaïlov and\r\n",
      "even allowed them to take copies of it--which I must say I think was\r\n",
      "superfluous. In this way she was busy for several days in driving about\r\n",
      "the whole town, because some people had taken offence through precedence\r\n",
      "having been given to others. And therefore they had to take turns, so\r\n",
      "that in every house she was expected before she arrived, and everyone\r\n",
      "knew that on such and such a day Marfa Petrovna would be reading the\r\n",
      "letter in such and such a place and people assembled for every reading\r\n",
      "of it, even many who had heard it several times already both in their\r\n",
      "own houses and in other people’s. In my opinion a great deal, a very\r\n",
      "great deal of all this was unnecessary; but that’s Marfa Petrovna’s\r\n",
      "character. Anyway she succeeded in completely re-establishing Dounia’s\r\n",
      "reputation and the whole ignominy of this affair rested as an indelible\r\n",
      "disgrace upon her husband, as the only person to blame, so that I really\r\n",
      "began to feel sorry for him; it was really treating the crazy fellow too\r\n",
      "harshly. Dounia was at once asked to give lessons in several families,\r\n",
      "but she refused. All of a sudden everyone began to treat her with marked\r\n",
      "respect and all this did much to bring about the event by which, one may\r\n",
      "say, our whole fortunes are now transformed. You must know, dear Rodya,\r\n",
      "that Dounia has a suitor and that she has already consented to marry\r\n",
      "him. I hasten to tell you all about the matter, and though it has been\r\n",
      "arranged without asking your consent, I think you will not be aggrieved\r\n",
      "with me or with your sister on that account, for you will see that we\r\n",
      "could not wait and put off our decision till we heard from you. And you\r\n",
      "could not have judged all the facts without being on the spot. This\r\n",
      "was how it happened. He is already of the rank of a counsellor, Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch Luzhin, and is distantly related to Marfa Petrovna, who\r\n",
      "has been very active in bringing the match about. It began with his\r\n",
      "expressing through her his desire to make our acquaintance. He was\r\n",
      "properly received, drank coffee with us and the very next day he sent\r\n",
      "us a letter in which he very courteously made an offer and begged for a\r\n",
      "speedy and decided answer. He is a very busy man and is in a great hurry\r\n",
      "to get to Petersburg, so that every moment is precious to him. At first,\r\n",
      "of course, we were greatly surprised, as it had all happened so quickly\r\n",
      "and unexpectedly. We thought and talked it over the whole day. He is a\r\n",
      "well-to-do man, to be depended upon, he has two posts in the government\r\n",
      "and has already made his fortune. It is true that he is forty-five years\r\n",
      "old, but he is of a fairly prepossessing appearance and might still be\r\n",
      "thought attractive by women, and he is altogether a very respectable and\r\n",
      "presentable man, only he seems a little morose and somewhat conceited.\r\n",
      "But possibly that may only be the impression he makes at first sight.\r\n",
      "And beware, dear Rodya, when he comes to Petersburg, as he shortly will\r\n",
      "do, beware of judging him too hastily and severely, as your way is, if\r\n",
      "there is anything you do not like in him at first sight. I give you this\r\n",
      "warning, although I feel sure that he will make a favourable impression\r\n",
      "upon you. Moreover, in order to understand any man one must be\r\n",
      "deliberate and careful to avoid forming prejudices and mistaken ideas,\r\n",
      "which are very difficult to correct and get over afterwards. And Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch, judging by many indications, is a thoroughly estimable man.\r\n",
      "At his first visit, indeed, he told us that he was a practical man, but\r\n",
      "still he shares, as he expressed it, many of the convictions ‘of our\r\n",
      "most rising generation’ and he is an opponent of all prejudices. He\r\n",
      "said a good deal more, for he seems a little conceited and likes to be\r\n",
      "listened to, but this is scarcely a vice. I, of course, understood very\r\n",
      "little of it, but Dounia explained to me that, though he is not a man\r\n",
      "of great education, he is clever and seems to be good-natured. You know\r\n",
      "your sister’s character, Rodya. She is a resolute, sensible, patient and\r\n",
      "generous girl, but she has a passionate heart, as I know very well.\r\n",
      "Of course, there is no great love either on his side, or on hers, but\r\n",
      "Dounia is a clever girl and has the heart of an angel, and will make\r\n",
      "it her duty to make her husband happy who on his side will make her\r\n",
      "happiness his care. Of that we have no good reason to doubt, though it\r\n",
      "must be admitted the matter has been arranged in great haste. Besides he\r\n",
      "is a man of great prudence and he will see, to be sure, of himself, that\r\n",
      "his own happiness will be the more secure, the happier Dounia is with\r\n",
      "him. And as for some defects of character, for some habits and even\r\n",
      "certain differences of opinion--which indeed are inevitable even in\r\n",
      "the happiest marriages--Dounia has said that, as regards all that, she\r\n",
      "relies on herself, that there is nothing to be uneasy about, and\r\n",
      "that she is ready to put up with a great deal, if only their future\r\n",
      "relationship can be an honourable and straightforward one. He struck me,\r\n",
      "for instance, at first, as rather abrupt, but that may well come\r\n",
      "from his being an outspoken man, and that is no doubt how it is. For\r\n",
      "instance, at his second visit, after he had received Dounia’s consent,\r\n",
      "in the course of conversation, he declared that before making\r\n",
      "Dounia’s acquaintance, he had made up his mind to marry a girl of\r\n",
      "good reputation, without dowry and, above all, one who had experienced\r\n",
      "poverty, because, as he explained, a man ought not to be indebted to his\r\n",
      "wife, but that it is better for a wife to look upon her husband as her\r\n",
      "benefactor. I must add that he expressed it more nicely and politely\r\n",
      "than I have done, for I have forgotten his actual phrases and only\r\n",
      "remember the meaning. And, besides, it was obviously not said of design,\r\n",
      "but slipped out in the heat of conversation, so that he tried afterwards\r\n",
      "to correct himself and smooth it over, but all the same it did strike\r\n",
      "me as somewhat rude, and I said so afterwards to Dounia. But Dounia was\r\n",
      "vexed, and answered that ‘words are not deeds,’ and that, of course, is\r\n",
      "perfectly true. Dounia did not sleep all night before she made up\r\n",
      "her mind, and, thinking that I was asleep, she got out of bed and was\r\n",
      "walking up and down the room all night; at last she knelt down before\r\n",
      "the ikon and prayed long and fervently and in the morning she told me\r\n",
      "that she had decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have mentioned already that Pyotr Petrovitch is just setting off for\r\n",
      "Petersburg, where he has a great deal of business, and he wants to open\r\n",
      "a legal bureau. He has been occupied for many years in conducting civil\r\n",
      "and commercial litigation, and only the other day he won an important\r\n",
      "case. He has to be in Petersburg because he has an important case before\r\n",
      "the Senate. So, Rodya dear, he may be of the greatest use to you, in\r\n",
      "every way indeed, and Dounia and I have agreed that from this very day\r\n",
      "you could definitely enter upon your career and might consider that\r\n",
      "your future is marked out and assured for you. Oh, if only this comes to\r\n",
      "pass! This would be such a benefit that we could only look upon it as a\r\n",
      "providential blessing. Dounia is dreaming of nothing else. We have even\r\n",
      "ventured already to drop a few words on the subject to Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "He was cautious in his answer, and said that, of course, as he could not\r\n",
      "get on without a secretary, it would be better to be paying a salary to\r\n",
      "a relation than to a stranger, if only the former were fitted for the\r\n",
      "duties (as though there could be doubt of your being fitted!) but then\r\n",
      "he expressed doubts whether your studies at the university would leave\r\n",
      "you time for work at his office. The matter dropped for the time, but\r\n",
      "Dounia is thinking of nothing else now. She has been in a sort of fever\r\n",
      "for the last few days, and has already made a regular plan for\r\n",
      "your becoming in the end an associate and even a partner in Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch’s business, which might well be, seeing that you are a\r\n",
      "student of law. I am in complete agreement with her, Rodya, and share\r\n",
      "all her plans and hopes, and think there is every probability of\r\n",
      "realising them. And in spite of Pyotr Petrovitch’s evasiveness, very\r\n",
      "natural at present (since he does not know you), Dounia is firmly\r\n",
      "persuaded that she will gain everything by her good influence over her\r\n",
      "future husband; this she is reckoning upon. Of course we are careful\r\n",
      "not to talk of any of these more remote plans to Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "especially of your becoming his partner. He is a practical man and might\r\n",
      "take this very coldly, it might all seem to him simply a day-dream. Nor\r\n",
      "has either Dounia or I breathed a word to him of the great hopes we have\r\n",
      "of his helping us to pay for your university studies; we have not spoken\r\n",
      "of it in the first place, because it will come to pass of itself,\r\n",
      "later on, and he will no doubt without wasting words offer to do it of\r\n",
      "himself, (as though he could refuse Dounia that) the more readily since\r\n",
      "you may by your own efforts become his right hand in the office, and\r\n",
      "receive this assistance not as a charity, but as a salary earned by your\r\n",
      "own work. Dounia wants to arrange it all like this and I quite agree\r\n",
      "with her. And we have not spoken of our plans for another reason, that\r\n",
      "is, because I particularly wanted you to feel on an equal footing when\r\n",
      "you first meet him. When Dounia spoke to him with enthusiasm about\r\n",
      "you, he answered that one could never judge of a man without seeing\r\n",
      "him close, for oneself, and that he looked forward to forming his own\r\n",
      "opinion when he makes your acquaintance. Do you know, my precious\r\n",
      "Rodya, I think that perhaps for some reasons (nothing to do with Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch though, simply for my own personal, perhaps old-womanish,\r\n",
      "fancies) I should do better to go on living by myself, apart, than with\r\n",
      "them, after the wedding. I am convinced that he will be generous and\r\n",
      "delicate enough to invite me and to urge me to remain with my daughter\r\n",
      "for the future, and if he has said nothing about it hitherto, it is\r\n",
      "simply because it has been taken for granted; but I shall refuse. I have\r\n",
      "noticed more than once in my life that husbands don’t quite get on with\r\n",
      "their mothers-in-law, and I don’t want to be the least bit in anyone’s\r\n",
      "way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so\r\n",
      "long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and\r\n",
      "Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most\r\n",
      "joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter:\r\n",
      "know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a\r\n",
      "very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of\r\n",
      "almost three years! It is settled _for certain_ that Dounia and I are to\r\n",
      "set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don’t know, but very, very soon,\r\n",
      "possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us\r\n",
      "know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg. To suit his\r\n",
      "own arrangements he is anxious to have the ceremony as soon as possible,\r\n",
      "even before the fast of Our Lady, if it could be managed, or if that is\r\n",
      "too soon to be ready, immediately after. Oh, with what happiness I shall\r\n",
      "press you to my heart! Dounia is all excitement at the joyful thought\r\n",
      "of seeing you, she said one day in joke that she would be ready to marry\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch for that alone. She is an angel! She is not writing\r\n",
      "anything to you now, and has only told me to write that she has so much,\r\n",
      "so much to tell you that she is not going to take up her pen now, for\r\n",
      "a few lines would tell you nothing, and it would only mean upsetting\r\n",
      "herself; she bids me send you her love and innumerable kisses. But\r\n",
      "although we shall be meeting so soon, perhaps I shall send you as much\r\n",
      "money as I can in a day or two. Now that everyone has heard that Dounia\r\n",

      "on the security of my pension, so that perhaps I shall be able to send\r\n",
      "you twenty-five or even thirty roubles. I would send you more, but I am\r\n",
      "uneasy about our travelling expenses; for though Pyotr Petrovitch has\r\n",
      "been so kind as to undertake part of the expenses of the journey, that\r\n",
      "is to say, he has taken upon himself the conveyance of our bags and big\r\n",

      "must reckon upon some expense on our arrival in Petersburg, where we\r\n",
      "can’t be left without a halfpenny, at least for the first few days. But\r\n",
      "we have calculated it all, Dounia and I, to the last penny, and we see\r\n",
      "that the journey will not cost very much. It is only ninety versts from\r\n",
      "us to the railway and we have come to an agreement with a driver we\r\n",
      "know, so as to be in readiness; and from there Dounia and I can travel\r\n",
      "quite comfortably third class. So that I may very likely be able to send\r\n",
      "to you not twenty-five, but thirty roubles. But enough; I have covered\r\n",
      "two sheets already and there is no space left for more; our whole\r\n",

      "does she write to me, ‘love Dounia, Rodya, and she loves you more than\r\n",
      "herself’? Has she a secret conscience-prick at sacrificing her daughter\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Hm... yes, that’s true,” he continued, pursuing the whirling ideas that\r\n",
      "chased each other in his brain, “it is true that ‘it needs time and care\r\n",
      "to get to know a man,’ but there is no mistake about Mr. Luzhin. The\r\n",
      "chief thing is he is ‘a man of business and _seems_ kind,’ that was\r\n",
      "something, wasn’t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man,\r\n",
      "no doubt after that! But his _bride_ and her mother are to drive in a\r\n",
      "peasant’s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in\r\n",
      "it). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can ‘travel very\r\n",
      "comfortably, third class,’ for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One\r\n",
      "must cut one’s coat according to one’s cloth, but what about you, Mr.\r\n",
      "Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has\r\n",
      "to raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it’s a matter\r\n",
      "of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and\r\n",
      "expenses;--food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The\r\n",
      "business man has got the better of them, too. The luggage will cost less\r\n",
      "than their fares and very likely go for nothing. How is it that they\r\n",
      "don’t both see all that, or is it that they don’t want to see? And\r\n",
      "they are pleased, pleased! And to think that this is only the first\r\n",
      "blossoming, and that the real fruits are to come! But what really\r\n",
      "matters is not the stinginess, is not the meanness, but the _tone_\r\n",
      "of the whole thing. For that will be the tone after marriage, it’s a\r\n",
      "foretaste of it. And mother too, why should she be so lavish? What will\r\n",
      "she have by the time she gets to Petersburg? Three silver roubles or\r\n",
      "two ‘paper ones’ as _she_ says.... that old woman... hm. What does\r\n",
      "she expect to live upon in Petersburg afterwards? She has her reasons\r\n",
      "already for guessing that she _could not_ live with Dounia after the\r\n",
      "marriage, even for the first few months. The good man has no doubt let\r\n",
      "slip something on that subject also, though mother would deny it: ‘I\r\n",

      "on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when\r\n",
      "Afanasy Ivanovitch’s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and\r\n",

      "more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know\r\n",
      "that. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin’s\r\n",
      "generosity; ‘he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.’\r\n",
      "You may wait a long time for that! That’s how it always is with these\r\n",

      "the picture, yet they won’t face the truth till they are forced to; the\r\n",
      "very thought of it makes them shiver; they thrust the truth away with\r\n",
      "both hands, until the man they deck out in false colours puts a fool’s\r\n",
      "cap on them with his own hands. I should like to know whether Mr. Luzhin\r\n",

      "for ever to a man whom she does not respect and with whom she has\r\n",
      "nothing in common--for her own advantage. And if Mr. Luzhin had been of\r\n",
      "unalloyed gold, or one huge diamond, she would never have consented to\r\n",
      "become his legal concubine. Why is she consenting then? What’s the\r\n",
      "point of it? What’s the answer? It’s clear enough: for herself, for her\r\n",

      "else she is doing it! For one she loves, for one she adores, she will\r\n",
      "sell herself! That’s what it all amounts to; for her brother, for her\r\n",
      "mother, she will sell herself! She will sell everything! In such cases,\r\n",

      "that he must not now suffer passively, worrying himself over unsolved\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He looked round hurriedly, he was searching for something. He wanted\r\n",
      "to sit down and was looking for a seat; he was walking along the K----\r\n",
      "Boulevard. There was a seat about a hundred paces in front of him. He\r\n",
      "walked towards it as fast he could; but on the way he met with a little\r\n",
      "adventure which absorbed all his attention. Looking for the seat, he had\r\n",
      "noticed a woman walking some twenty paces in front of him, but at first\r\n",
      "he took no more notice of her than of other objects that crossed his\r\n",
      "path. It had happened to him many times going home not to notice the\r\n",
      "road by which he was going, and he was accustomed to walk like that. But\r\n",
      "there was at first sight something so strange about the woman in front\r\n",
      "of him, that gradually his attention was riveted upon her, at first\r\n",
      "reluctantly and, as it were, resentfully, and then more and more\r\n",
      "intently. He felt a sudden desire to find out what it was that was so\r\n",
      "strange about the woman. In the first place, she appeared to be a girl\r\n",
      "quite young, and she was walking in the great heat bareheaded and with\r\n",
      "no parasol or gloves, waving her arms about in an absurd way. She had\r\n",
      "on a dress of some light silky material, but put on strangely awry, not\r\n",
      "properly hooked up, and torn open at the top of the skirt, close to the\r\n",
      "waist: a great piece was rent and hanging loose. A little kerchief was\r\n",
      "flung about her bare throat, but lay slanting on one side. The girl was\r\n",
      "walking unsteadily, too, stumbling and staggering from side to side. She\r\n",
      "drew Raskolnikov’s whole attention at last. He overtook the girl at the\r\n",
      "seat, but, on reaching it, she dropped down on it, in the corner;\r\n",
      "she let her head sink on the back of the seat and closed her eyes,\r\n",
      "apparently in extreme exhaustion. Looking at her closely, he saw at once\r\n",
      "that she was completely drunk. It was a strange and shocking sight. He\r\n",
      "could hardly believe that he was not mistaken. He saw before him the\r\n",
      "face of a quite young, fair-haired girl--sixteen, perhaps not more than\r\n",
      "fifteen, years old, pretty little face, but flushed and heavy looking\r\n",
      "and, as it were, swollen. The girl seemed hardly to know what she was\r\n",
      "doing; she crossed one leg over the other, lifting it indecorously, and\r\n",
      "showed every sign of being unconscious that she was in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov did not sit down, but he felt unwilling to leave her,\r\n",
      "and stood facing her in perplexity. This boulevard was never much\r\n",
      "frequented; and now, at two o’clock, in the stifling heat, it was quite\r\n",
      "deserted. And yet on the further side of the boulevard, about fifteen\r\n",
      "paces away, a gentleman was standing on the edge of the pavement. He,\r\n",
      "too, would apparently have liked to approach the girl with some object\r\n",
      "of his own. He, too, had probably seen her in the distance and had\r\n",
      "followed her, but found Raskolnikov in his way. He looked angrily at\r\n",
      "him, though he tried to escape his notice, and stood impatiently biding\r\n",
      "his time, till the unwelcome man in rags should have moved away. His\r\n",
      "intentions were unmistakable. The gentleman was a plump, thickly-set\r\n",
      "man, about thirty, fashionably dressed, with a high colour, red lips and\r\n",
      "moustaches. Raskolnikov felt furious; he had a sudden longing to insult\r\n",
      "this fat dandy in some way. He left the girl for a moment and walked\r\n",
      "towards the gentleman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hey! You Svidrigaïlov! What do you want here?” he shouted, clenching\r\n",
      "his fists and laughing, spluttering with rage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean?” the gentleman asked sternly, scowling in haughty\r\n",
      "astonishment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get away, that’s what I mean.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How dare you, you low fellow!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his cane. Raskolnikov rushed at him with his fists, without\r\n",
      "reflecting that the stout gentleman was a match for two men like\r\n",
      "himself. But at that instant someone seized him from behind, and a\r\n",
      "police constable stood between them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s enough, gentlemen, no fighting, please, in a public place. What\r\n",
      "do you want? Who are you?” he asked Raskolnikov sternly, noticing his\r\n",
      "rags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked at him intently. He had a straight-forward, sensible,\r\n",
      "soldierly face, with grey moustaches and whiskers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are just the man I want,” Raskolnikov cried, catching at his arm.\r\n",
      "“I am a student, Raskolnikov.... You may as well know that too,” he\r\n",
      "added, addressing the gentleman, “come along, I have something to show\r\n",
      "you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And taking the policeman by the hand he drew him towards the seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, hopelessly drunk, and she has just come down the boulevard.\r\n",
      "There is no telling who and what she is, she does not look like a\r\n",
      "professional. It’s more likely she has been given drink and deceived\r\n",
      "somewhere... for the first time... you understand? and they’ve put her\r\n",
      "out into the street like that. Look at the way her dress is torn, and\r\n",
      "the way it has been put on: she has been dressed by somebody, she has\r\n",
      "not dressed herself, and dressed by unpractised hands, by a man’s hands;\r\n",
      "that’s evident. And now look there: I don’t know that dandy with whom I\r\n",
      "was going to fight, I see him for the first time, but he, too, has seen\r\n",
      "her on the road, just now, drunk, not knowing what she is doing, and now\r\n",
      "he is very eager to get hold of her, to get her away somewhere while she\r\n",
      "is in this state... that’s certain, believe me, I am not wrong. I saw\r\n",
      "him myself watching her and following her, but I prevented him, and he\r\n",
      "is just waiting for me to go away. Now he has walked away a little, and\r\n",
      "is standing still, pretending to make a cigarette.... Think how can we\r\n",
      "keep her out of his hands, and how are we to get her home?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The policeman saw it all in a flash. The stout gentleman was easy to\r\n",
      "understand, he turned to consider the girl. The policeman bent over to\r\n",
      "examine her more closely, and his face worked with genuine compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, what a pity!” he said, shaking his head--“why, she is quite a\r\n",
      "child! She has been deceived, you can see that at once. Listen, lady,”\r\n",
      " he began addressing her, “where do you live?” The girl opened her weary\r\n",
      "and sleepy-looking eyes, gazed blankly at the speaker and waved her\r\n",
      "hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here,” said Raskolnikov feeling in his pocket and finding twenty\r\n",
      "copecks, “here, call a cab and tell him to drive her to her address. The\r\n",
      "only thing is to find out her address!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Missy, missy!” the policeman began again, taking the money. “I’ll fetch\r\n",
      "you a cab and take you home myself. Where shall I take you, eh? Where do\r\n",
      "you live?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go away! They won’t let me alone,” the girl muttered, and once more\r\n",
      "waved her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, ach, how shocking! It’s shameful, missy, it’s a shame!” He shook\r\n",
      "his head again, shocked, sympathetic and indignant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a difficult job,” the policeman said to Raskolnikov, and as he\r\n",
      "did so, he looked him up and down in a rapid glance. He, too, must have\r\n",
      "seemed a strange figure to him: dressed in rags and handing him money!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you meet her far from here?” he asked him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to fix his mind on anything at that moment. He longed to forget himself\r\n",

      "go... that way... to the devil, I suppose, so that the rest may remain\r\n",
      "chaste, and not be interfered with. A percentage! What splendid words\r\n",
      "they have; they are so scientific, so consolatory.... Once you’ve said\r\n",
      "‘percentage’ there’s nothing more to worry about. If we had any other\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“But where am I going?” he thought suddenly. “Strange, I came out for\r\n",
      "something. As soon as I had read the letter I came out.... I was going\r\n",
      "to Vassilyevsky Ostrov, to Razumihin. That’s what it was... now I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He wondered at himself. Razumihin was one of his old comrades at the\r\n",
      "university. It was remarkable that Raskolnikov had hardly any friends at\r\n",
      "the university; he kept aloof from everyone, went to see no one, and did\r\n",
      "not welcome anyone who came to see him, and indeed everyone soon gave\r\n",
      "him up. He took no part in the students’ gatherings, amusements or\r\n",
      "conversations. He worked with great intensity without sparing himself,\r\n",
      "and he was respected for this, but no one liked him. He was very poor,\r\n",
      "and there was a sort of haughty pride and reserve about him, as though\r\n",
      "he were keeping something to himself. He seemed to some of his comrades\r\n",
      "to look down upon them all as children, as though he were superior in\r\n",
      "development, knowledge and convictions, as though their beliefs and\r\n",
      "interests were beneath him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With Razumihin he had got on, or, at least, he was more unreserved and\r\n",
      "communicative with him. Indeed it was impossible to be on any other\r\n",
      "terms with Razumihin. He was an exceptionally good-humoured and candid\r\n",
      "youth, good-natured to the point of simplicity, though both depth and\r\n",
      "dignity lay concealed under that simplicity. The better of his comrades\r\n",
      "understood this, and all were fond of him. He was extremely intelligent,\r\n",
      "though he was certainly rather a simpleton at times. He was of striking\r\n",
      "appearance--tall, thin, blackhaired and always badly shaved. He was\r\n",
      "sometimes uproarious and was reputed to be of great physical strength.\r\n",
      "One night, when out in a festive company, he had with one blow laid\r\n",
      "a gigantic policeman on his back. There was no limit to his drinking\r\n",
      "powers, but he could abstain from drink altogether; he sometimes went\r\n",
      "too far in his pranks; but he could do without pranks altogether.\r\n",
      "Another thing striking about Razumihin, no failure distressed him, and\r\n",
      "it seemed as though no unfavourable circumstances could crush him. He\r\n",
      "could lodge anywhere, and bear the extremes of cold and hunger. He was\r\n",
      "very poor, and kept himself entirely on what he could earn by work of\r\n",
      "one sort or another. He knew of no end of resources by which to earn\r\n",
      "money. He spent one whole winter without lighting his stove, and used to\r\n",
      "declare that he liked it better, because one slept more soundly in\r\n",
      "the cold. For the present he, too, had been obliged to give up the\r\n",
      "university, but it was only for a time, and he was working with all his\r\n",
      "might to save enough to return to his studies again. Raskolnikov had\r\n",
      "not been to see him for the last four months, and Razumihin did not even\r\n",
      "know his address. About two months before, they had met in the street,\r\n",
      "but Raskolnikov had turned away and even crossed to the other side that\r\n",
      "he might not be observed. And though Razumihin noticed him, he passed\r\n",

      "“Of course, I’ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin’s to ask for\r\n",
      "work, to ask him to get me lessons or something...” Raskolnikov thought,\r\n",
      "“but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose\r\n",
      "he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Could I have expected to set it all straight and to find a way out by\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He pondered and rubbed his forehead, and, strange to say, after long\r\n",
      "musing, suddenly, as if it were spontaneously and by chance, a fantastic\r\n",
      "thought came into his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm... to Razumihin’s,” he said all at once, calmly, as though he had\r\n",

      "going to happen? Is it possible it really will happen?” He left the\r\n",
      "seat, and went off almost at a run; he meant to turn back, homewards,\r\n",
      "but the thought of going home suddenly filled him with intense loathing;\r\n",
      "in that hole, in that awful little cupboard of his, all _this_ had for a\r\n",
      "month past been growing up in him; and he walked on at random.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His nervous shudder had passed into a fever that made him feel\r\n",
      "shivering; in spite of the heat he felt cold. With a kind of effort he\r\n",
      "began almost unconsciously, from some inner craving, to stare at all\r\n",
      "the objects before him, as though looking for something to distract his\r\n",
      "attention; but he did not succeed, and kept dropping every moment into\r\n",
      "brooding. When with a start he lifted his head again and looked round,\r\n",
      "he forgot at once what he had just been thinking about and even where he\r\n",
      "was going. In this way he walked right across Vassilyevsky Ostrov, came\r\n",
      "out on to the Lesser Neva, crossed the bridge and turned towards the\r\n",
      "islands. The greenness and freshness were at first restful to his weary\r\n",
      "eyes after the dust of the town and the huge houses that hemmed him in\r\n",
      "and weighed upon him. Here there were no taverns, no stifling closeness,\r\n",
      "no stench. But soon these new pleasant sensations passed into morbid\r\n",
      "irritability. Sometimes he stood still before a brightly painted summer\r\n",
      "villa standing among green foliage, he gazed through the fence, he saw\r\n",
      "in the distance smartly dressed women on the verandahs and balconies,\r\n",
      "and children running in the gardens. The flowers especially caught his\r\n",
      "attention; he gazed at them longer than at anything. He was met, too, by\r\n",
      "luxurious carriages and by men and women on horseback; he watched them\r\n",
      "with curious eyes and forgot about them before they had vanished from\r\n",
      "his sight. Once he stood still and counted his money; he found he had\r\n",
      "thirty copecks. “Twenty to the policeman, three to Nastasya for the\r\n",
      "letter, so I must have given forty-seven or fifty to the Marmeladovs\r\n",
      "yesterday,” he thought, reckoning it up for some unknown reason, but he\r\n",
      "soon forgot with what object he had taken the money out of his pocket.\r\n",
      "He recalled it on passing an eating-house or tavern, and felt that he\r\n",
      "was hungry.... Going into the tavern he drank a glass of vodka and ate a\r\n",
      "pie of some sort. He finished eating it as he walked away. It was a long\r\n",
      "while since he had taken vodka and it had an effect upon him at once,\r\n",
      "though he only drank a wineglassful. His legs felt suddenly heavy and\r\n",
      "a great drowsiness came upon him. He turned homewards, but reaching\r\n",
      "Petrovsky Ostrov he stopped completely exhausted, turned off the road\r\n",
      "into the bushes, sank down upon the grass and instantly fell asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a morbid condition of the brain, dreams often have a singular\r\n",
      "actuality, vividness, and extraordinary semblance of reality. At times\r\n",
      "monstrous images are created, but the setting and the whole picture are\r\n",
      "so truth-like and filled with details so delicate, so unexpectedly, but\r\n",
      "so artistically consistent, that the dreamer, were he an artist like\r\n",
      "Pushkin or Turgenev even, could never have invented them in the waking\r\n",
      "state. Such sick dreams always remain long in the memory and make a\r\n",
      "powerful impression on the overwrought and deranged nervous system.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had a fearful dream. He dreamt he was back in his childhood\r\n",
      "in the little town of his birth. He was a child about seven years old,\r\n",
      "walking into the country with his father on the evening of a holiday. It\r\n",
      "was a grey and heavy day, the country was exactly as he remembered it;\r\n",
      "indeed he recalled it far more vividly in his dream than he had done in\r\n",
      "memory. The little town stood on a level flat as bare as the hand, not\r\n",
      "even a willow near it; only in the far distance, a copse lay, a dark\r\n",
      "blur on the very edge of the horizon. A few paces beyond the last market\r\n",
      "garden stood a tavern, a big tavern, which had always aroused in him a\r\n",
      "feeling of aversion, even of fear, when he walked by it with his father.\r\n",
      "There was always a crowd there, always shouting, laughter and abuse,\r\n",
      "hideous hoarse singing and often fighting. Drunken and horrible-looking\r\n",
      "figures were hanging about the tavern. He used to cling close to his\r\n",
      "father, trembling all over when he met them. Near the tavern the road\r\n",
      "became a dusty track, the dust of which was always black. It was a\r\n",
      "winding road, and about a hundred paces further on, it turned to the\r\n",
      "right to the graveyard. In the middle of the graveyard stood a stone\r\n",
      "church with a green cupola where he used to go to mass two or three\r\n",
      "times a year with his father and mother, when a service was held in\r\n",
      "memory of his grandmother, who had long been dead, and whom he had never\r\n",
      "seen. On these occasions they used to take on a white dish tied up in a\r\n",
      "table napkin a special sort of rice pudding with raisins stuck in it in\r\n",
      "the shape of a cross. He loved that church, the old-fashioned, unadorned\r\n",
      "ikons and the old priest with the shaking head. Near his grandmother’s\r\n",
      "grave, which was marked by a stone, was the little grave of his younger\r\n",
      "brother who had died at six months old. He did not remember him at all,\r\n",
      "but he had been told about his little brother, and whenever he visited\r\n",
      "the graveyard he used religiously and reverently to cross himself and\r\n",
      "to bow down and kiss the little grave. And now he dreamt that he was\r\n",
      "walking with his father past the tavern on the way to the graveyard; he\r\n",
      "was holding his father’s hand and looking with dread at the tavern. A\r\n",
      "peculiar circumstance attracted his attention: there seemed to be\r\n",
      "some kind of festivity going on, there were crowds of gaily dressed\r\n",
      "townspeople, peasant women, their husbands, and riff-raff of all sorts,\r\n",
      "all singing and all more or less drunk. Near the entrance of the tavern\r\n",
      "stood a cart, but a strange cart. It was one of those big carts usually\r\n",
      "drawn by heavy cart-horses and laden with casks of wine or other heavy\r\n",
      "goods. He always liked looking at those great cart-horses, with their\r\n",
      "long manes, thick legs, and slow even pace, drawing along a perfect\r\n",
      "mountain with no appearance of effort, as though it were easier going\r\n",
      "with a load than without it. But now, strange to say, in the shafts of\r\n",
      "such a cart he saw a thin little sorrel beast, one of those peasants’\r\n",
      "nags which he had often seen straining their utmost under a heavy load\r\n",
      "of wood or hay, especially when the wheels were stuck in the mud or in\r\n",
      "a rut. And the peasants would beat them so cruelly, sometimes even\r\n",
      "about the nose and eyes, and he felt so sorry, so sorry for them that\r\n",
      "he almost cried, and his mother always used to take him away from the\r\n",
      "window. All of a sudden there was a great uproar of shouting, singing\r\n",
      "and the balalaïka, and from the tavern a number of big and very drunken\r\n",
      "peasants came out, wearing red and blue shirts and coats thrown over\r\n",
      "their shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in, get in!” shouted one of them, a young thick-necked peasant with\r\n",
      "a fleshy face red as a carrot. “I’ll take you all, get in!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at once there was an outbreak of laughter and exclamations in the\r\n",
      "crowd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take us all with a beast like that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“And this mare is twenty if she is a day, mates!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in, I’ll take you all,” Mikolka shouted again, leaping first into\r\n",
      "the cart, seizing the reins and standing straight up in front. “The bay\r\n",
      "has gone with Matvey,” he shouted from the cart--“and this brute, mates,\r\n",
      "is just breaking my heart, I feel as if I could kill her. She’s just\r\n",
      "eating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I’ll make her gallop! She’ll\r\n",
      "gallop!” and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to\r\n",
      "flog the little mare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in! Come along!” The crowd laughed. “D’you hear, she’ll gallop!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Don’t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right! Give it to her!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all clambered into Mikolka’s cart, laughing and making jokes. Six\r\n",
      "men got in and there was still room for more. They hauled in a fat,\r\n",
      "rosy-cheeked woman. She was dressed in red cotton, in a pointed, beaded\r\n",
      "headdress and thick leather shoes; she was cracking nuts and laughing.\r\n",
      "The crowd round them was laughing too and indeed, how could they help\r\n",
      "laughing? That wretched nag was to drag all the cartload of them at a\r\n",
      "gallop! Two young fellows in the cart were just getting whips ready to\r\n",
      "help Mikolka. With the cry of “now,” the mare tugged with all her might,\r\n",
      "but far from galloping, could scarcely move forward; she struggled with\r\n",
      "her legs, gasping and shrinking from the blows of the three whips which\r\n",
      "were showered upon her like hail. The laughter in the cart and in the\r\n",
      "crowd was redoubled, but Mikolka flew into a rage and furiously thrashed\r\n",
      "the mare, as though he supposed she really could gallop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me get in, too, mates,” shouted a young man in the crowd whose\r\n",
      "appetite was aroused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Get in, all get in,” cried Mikolka, “she will draw you all. I’ll beat\r\n",
      "her to death!” And he thrashed and thrashed at the mare, beside himself\r\n",
      "with fury.\r\n",

      "shaking his head in disapproval. One woman seized him by the hand and\r\n",
      "would have taken him away, but he tore himself from her and ran back to\r\n",
      "the mare. She was almost at the last gasp, but began kicking once more.\r\n",

      "again and fell upon her a third time, then a fourth, with heavy measured\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Finish her off,” shouted Mikolka and he leapt beside himself, out of\r\n",

      "mare. Mikolka stood on one side and began dealing random blows with the\r\n",

      "his father, who had been running after him, snatched him up and carried\r\n",

      "Such a hideous dream!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "shall tread in the sticky warm blood, break the lock, steal and tremble;\r\n",

      "were in profound amazement. “I knew that I could never bring myself\r\n",
      "to it, so what have I been torturing myself for till now? Yesterday,\r\n",
      "yesterday, when I went to make that... _experiment_, yesterday I\r\n",
      "realised completely that I could never bear to do it.... Why am I going\r\n",
      "over it again, then? Why am I hesitating? As I came down the stairs\r\n",
      "yesterday, I said myself that it was base, loathsome, vile, vile... the\r\n",
      "very thought of it made me feel sick and filled me with horror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I couldn’t do it, I couldn’t do it! Granted, granted that there is\r\n",

      "month is clear as day, true as arithmetic.... My God! Anyway I couldn’t\r\n",

      "I still...?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rose to his feet, looked round in wonder as though surprised at\r\n",
      "finding himself in this place, and went towards the bridge. He was pale,\r\n",
      "his eyes glowed, he was exhausted in every limb, but he seemed suddenly\r\n",
      "to breathe more easily. He felt he had cast off that fearful burden that\r\n",
      "had so long been weighing upon him, and all at once there was a sense\r\n",
      "of relief and peace in his soul. “Lord,” he prayed, “show me my path--I\r\n",
      "renounce that accursed... dream of mine.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Crossing the bridge, he gazed quietly and calmly at the Neva, at the\r\n",
      "glowing red sun setting in the glowing sky. In spite of his weakness he\r\n",
      "was not conscious of fatigue. It was as though an abscess that had been\r\n",
      "forming for a month past in his heart had suddenly broken. Freedom,\r\n",
      "freedom! He was free from that spell, that sorcery, that obsession!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later on, when he recalled that time and all that happened to him during\r\n",
      "those days, minute by minute, point by point, he was superstitiously\r\n",
      "impressed by one circumstance, which, though in itself not very\r\n",
      "exceptional, always seemed to him afterwards the predestined\r\n",
      "turning-point of his fate. He could never understand and explain to\r\n",
      "himself why, when he was tired and worn out, when it would have been\r\n",
      "more convenient for him to go home by the shortest and most direct way,\r\n",
      "he had returned by the Hay Market where he had no need to go. It was\r\n",
      "obviously and quite unnecessarily out of his way, though not much so. It\r\n",
      "is true that it happened to him dozens of times to return home without\r\n",
      "noticing what streets he passed through. But why, he was always asking\r\n",
      "himself, why had such an important, such a decisive and at the same time\r\n",
      "such an absolutely chance meeting happened in the Hay Market (where he\r\n",
      "had moreover no reason to go) at the very hour, the very minute of his\r\n",
      "life when he was just in the very mood and in the very circumstances\r\n",
      "in which that meeting was able to exert the gravest and most decisive\r\n",
      "influence on his whole destiny? As though it had been lying in wait for\r\n",
      "him on purpose!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was about nine o’clock when he crossed the Hay Market. At the tables\r\n",
      "and the barrows, at the booths and the shops, all the market people were\r\n",
      "closing their establishments or clearing away and packing up their\r\n",
      "wares and, like their customers, were going home. Rag pickers and\r\n",
      "costermongers of all kinds were crowding round the taverns in the dirty\r\n",
      "and stinking courtyards of the Hay Market. Raskolnikov particularly\r\n",
      "liked this place and the neighbouring alleys, when he wandered aimlessly\r\n",
      "in the streets. Here his rags did not attract contemptuous attention,\r\n",
      "and one could walk about in any attire without scandalising people. At\r\n",
      "the corner of an alley a huckster and his wife had two tables set out\r\n",
      "with tapes, thread, cotton handkerchiefs, etc. They, too, had got up to\r\n",
      "go home, but were lingering in conversation with a friend, who had just\r\n",
      "come up to them. This friend was Lizaveta Ivanovna, or, as everyone\r\n",
      "called her, Lizaveta, the younger sister of the old pawnbroker, Alyona\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, whom Raskolnikov had visited the previous day to pawn his\r\n",
      "watch and make his _experiment_.... He already knew all about Lizaveta\r\n",
      "and she knew him a little too. She was a single woman of about\r\n",
      "thirty-five, tall, clumsy, timid, submissive and almost idiotic. She was\r\n",
      "a complete slave and went in fear and trembling of her sister, who\r\n",
      "made her work day and night, and even beat her. She was standing with\r\n",
      "a bundle before the huckster and his wife, listening earnestly and\r\n",
      "doubtfully. They were talking of something with special warmth. The\r\n",
      "moment Raskolnikov caught sight of her, he was overcome by a strange\r\n",
      "sensation as it were of intense astonishment, though there was nothing\r\n",
      "astonishing about this meeting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You could make up your mind for yourself, Lizaveta Ivanovna,” the\r\n",
      "huckster was saying aloud. “Come round to-morrow about seven. They will\r\n",
      "be here too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-morrow?” said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to\r\n",
      "make up her mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,” gabbled\r\n",
      "the huckster’s wife, a lively little woman. “I look at you, you are like\r\n",
      "some little babe. And she is not your own sister either--nothing but a\r\n",
      "step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But this time don’t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,” her husband\r\n",
      "interrupted; “that’s my advice, but come round to us without asking.\r\n",
      "It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a\r\n",
      "notion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Am I to come?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“About seven o’clock to-morrow. And they will be here. You will be able\r\n",
      "to decide for yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And we’ll have a cup of tea,” added his wife.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right, I’ll come,” said Lizaveta, still pondering, and she began\r\n",
      "slowly moving away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had just passed and heard no more. He passed softly,\r\n",
      "unnoticed, trying not to miss a word. His first amazement was followed\r\n",
      "by a thrill of horror, like a shiver running down his spine. He had\r\n",
      "learnt, he had suddenly quite unexpectedly learnt, that the next day at\r\n",
      "seven o’clock Lizaveta, the old woman’s sister and only companion, would\r\n",
      "be away from home and that therefore at seven o’clock precisely the old\r\n",
      "woman _would be left alone_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was only a few steps from his lodging. He went in like a man\r\n",
      "condemned to death. He thought of nothing and was incapable of thinking;\r\n",
      "but he felt suddenly in his whole being that he had no more freedom\r\n",
      "of thought, no will, and that everything was suddenly and irrevocably\r\n",
      "decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Certainly, if he had to wait whole years for a suitable opportunity, he\r\n",
      "could not reckon on a more certain step towards the success of the plan\r\n",
      "than that which had just presented itself. In any case, it would have\r\n",
      "been difficult to find out beforehand and with certainty, with\r\n",
      "greater exactness and less risk, and without dangerous inquiries and\r\n",
      "investigations, that next day at a certain time an old woman, on whose\r\n",
      "life an attempt was contemplated, would be at home and entirely alone.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER VI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Later on Raskolnikov happened to find out why the huckster and his\r\n",
      "wife had invited Lizaveta. It was a very ordinary matter and there was\r\n",
      "nothing exceptional about it. A family who had come to the town and been\r\n",
      "reduced to poverty were selling their household goods and clothes, all\r\n",
      "women’s things. As the things would have fetched little in the market,\r\n",
      "they were looking for a dealer. This was Lizaveta’s business. She\r\n",
      "undertook such jobs and was frequently employed, as she was very honest\r\n",
      "and always fixed a fair price and stuck to it. She spoke as a rule\r\n",
      "little and, as we have said already, she was very submissive and timid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Raskolnikov had become superstitious of late. The traces of\r\n",
      "superstition remained in him long after, and were almost ineradicable.\r\n",
      "And in all this he was always afterwards disposed to see something\r\n",
      "strange and mysterious, as it were, the presence of some peculiar\r\n",
      "influences and coincidences. In the previous winter a student he knew\r\n",
      "called Pokorev, who had left for Harkov, had chanced in conversation to\r\n",
      "give him the address of Alyona Ivanovna, the old pawnbroker, in case he\r\n",
      "might want to pawn anything. For a long while he did not go to her, for\r\n",
      "he had lessons and managed to get along somehow. Six weeks ago he had\r\n",
      "remembered the address; he had two articles that could be pawned: his\r\n",
      "father’s old silver watch and a little gold ring with three red stones,\r\n",
      "a present from his sister at parting. He decided to take the ring. When\r\n",
      "he found the old woman he had felt an insurmountable repulsion for her\r\n",
      "at the first glance, though he knew nothing special about her. He got\r\n",
      "two roubles from her and went into a miserable little tavern on his way\r\n",
      "home. He asked for tea, sat down and sank into deep thought. A strange\r\n",
      "idea was pecking at his brain like a chicken in the egg, and very, very\r\n",
      "much absorbed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost beside him at the next table there was sitting a student, whom he\r\n",
      "did not know and had never seen, and with him a young officer. They had\r\n",
      "played a game of billiards and began drinking tea. All at once he heard\r\n",
      "the student mention to the officer the pawnbroker Alyona Ivanovna and\r\n",
      "give him her address. This of itself seemed strange to Raskolnikov; he\r\n",
      "had just come from her and here at once he heard her name. Of course\r\n",
      "it was a chance, but he could not shake off a very extraordinary\r\n",
      "impression, and here someone seemed to be speaking expressly for him;\r\n",
      "the student began telling his friend various details about Alyona\r\n",
      "Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is first-rate,” he said. “You can always get money from her. She is\r\n",
      "as rich as a Jew, she can give you five thousand roubles at a time and\r\n",
      "she is not above taking a pledge for a rouble. Lots of our fellows have\r\n",
      "had dealings with her. But she is an awful old harpy....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he began describing how spiteful and uncertain she was, how if you\r\n",
      "were only a day late with your interest the pledge was lost; how she\r\n",
      "gave a quarter of the value of an article and took five and even seven\r\n",
      "percent a month on it and so on. The student chattered on, saying\r\n",
      "that she had a sister Lizaveta, whom the wretched little creature was\r\n",
      "continually beating, and kept in complete bondage like a small child,\r\n",
      "though Lizaveta was at least six feet high.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s a phenomenon for you,” cried the student and he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They began talking about Lizaveta. The student spoke about her with a\r\n",
      "peculiar relish and was continually laughing and the officer listened\r\n",
      "with great interest and asked him to send Lizaveta to do some mending\r\n",
      "for him. Raskolnikov did not miss a word and learned everything about\r\n",
      "her. Lizaveta was younger than the old woman and was her half-sister,\r\n",
      "being the child of a different mother. She was thirty-five. She worked\r\n",
      "day and night for her sister, and besides doing the cooking and the\r\n",
      "washing, she did sewing and worked as a charwoman and gave her sister\r\n",
      "all she earned. She did not dare to accept an order or job of any kind\r\n",
      "without her sister’s permission. The old woman had already made her\r\n",
      "will, and Lizaveta knew of it, and by this will she would not get a\r\n",
      "farthing; nothing but the movables, chairs and so on; all the money was\r\n",
      "left to a monastery in the province of N----, that prayers might be\r\n",
      "said for her in perpetuity. Lizaveta was of lower rank than her sister,\r\n",
      "unmarried and awfully uncouth in appearance, remarkably tall with long\r\n",
      "feet that looked as if they were bent outwards. She always wore battered\r\n",
      "goatskin shoes, and was clean in her person. What the student expressed\r\n",
      "most surprise and amusement about was the fact that Lizaveta was\r\n",
      "continually with child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you say she is hideous?” observed the officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, she is so dark-skinned and looks like a soldier dressed up, but\r\n",
      "you know she is not at all hideous. She has such a good-natured face\r\n",
      "and eyes. Strikingly so. And the proof of it is that lots of people are\r\n",
      "attracted by her. She is such a soft, gentle creature, ready to put up\r\n",
      "with anything, always willing, willing to do anything. And her smile is\r\n",
      "really very sweet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem to find her attractive yourself,” laughed the officer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From her queerness. No, I’ll tell you what. I could kill that damned\r\n",
      "old woman and make off with her money, I assure you, without the\r\n",
      "faintest conscience-prick,” the student added with warmth. The officer\r\n",
      "laughed again while Raskolnikov shuddered. How strange it was!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, I want to ask you a serious question,” the student said hotly.\r\n",
      "“I was joking of course, but look here; on one side we have a stupid,\r\n",
      "senseless, worthless, spiteful, ailing, horrid old woman, not simply\r\n",
      "useless but doing actual mischief, who has not an idea what she is\r\n",
      "living for herself, and who will die in a day or two in any case. You\r\n",
      "understand? You understand?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I understand,” answered the officer, watching his excited\r\n",
      "companion attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, listen then. On the other side, fresh young lives thrown away for\r\n",
      "want of help and by thousands, on every side! A hundred thousand good\r\n",
      "deeds could be done and helped, on that old woman’s money which will be\r\n",
      "buried in a monastery! Hundreds, thousands perhaps, might be set on the\r\n",
      "right path; dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from\r\n",
      "vice, from the Lock hospitals--and all with her money. Kill her, take\r\n",
      "her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of\r\n",
      "humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny\r\n",
      "crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands\r\n",
      "would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives\r\n",
      "in exchange--it’s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of\r\n",
      "that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence!\r\n",
      "No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact\r\n",
      "because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of\r\n",
      "others; the other day she bit Lizaveta’s finger out of spite; it almost\r\n",
      "had to be amputated.”\r\n",

      "for that, we should drown in an ocean of prejudice. But for that,\r\n",
      "there would never have been a single great man. They talk of\r\n",
      "duty, conscience--I don’t want to say anything against duty and\r\n",

      "such a discussion and such ideas at the very moment when his own brain\r\n",
      "was just conceiving... _the very same ideas_? And why, just at the\r\n",
      "moment when he had brought away the embryo of his idea from the old\r\n",
      "woman had he dropped at once upon a conversation about her? This\r\n",

      "On returning from the Hay Market he flung himself on the sofa and sat\r\n",
      "for a whole hour without stirring. Meanwhile it got dark; he had no\r\n",
      "candle and, indeed, it did not occur to him to light up. He could never\r\n",
      "recollect whether he had been thinking about anything at that time. At\r\n",
      "last he was conscious of his former fever and shivering, and he realised\r\n",
      "with relief that he could lie down on the sofa. Soon heavy, leaden sleep\r\n",
      "came over him, as it were crushing him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He slept an extraordinarily long time and without dreaming. Nastasya,\r\n",
      "coming into his room at ten o’clock the next morning, had difficulty\r\n",
      "in rousing him. She brought him in tea and bread. The tea was again the\r\n",
      "second brew and again in her own tea-pot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My goodness, how he sleeps!” she cried indignantly. “And he is always\r\n",
      "asleep.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up with an effort. His head ached, he stood up, took a turn in\r\n",
      "his garret and sank back on the sofa again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Going to sleep again,” cried Nastasya. “Are you ill, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made no reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you want some tea?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Afterwards,” he said with an effort, closing his eyes again and turning\r\n",
      "to the wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya stood over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps he really is ill,” she said, turned and went out. She came in\r\n",
      "again at two o’clock with soup. He was lying as before. The tea stood\r\n",
      "untouched. Nastasya felt positively offended and began wrathfully\r\n",
      "rousing him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why are you lying like a log?” she shouted, looking at him with\r\n",
      "repulsion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up, and sat down again, but said nothing and stared at the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you ill or not?” asked Nastasya and again received no answer.\r\n",
      "“You’d better go out and get a breath of air,” she said after a pause.\r\n",
      "“Will you eat it or not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Afterwards,” he said weakly. “You can go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he motioned her out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She remained a little longer, looked at him with compassion and went\r\n",
      "out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few minutes afterwards, he raised his eyes and looked for a long while\r\n",
      "at the tea and the soup. Then he took the bread, took up a spoon and\r\n",
      "began to eat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He ate a little, three or four spoonfuls, without appetite, as it were\r\n",
      "mechanically. His head ached less. After his meal he stretched himself\r\n",
      "on the sofa again, but now he could not sleep; he lay without stirring,\r\n",
      "with his face in the pillow. He was haunted by day-dreams and such\r\n",
      "strange day-dreams; in one, that kept recurring, he fancied that he was\r\n",
      "in Africa, in Egypt, in some sort of oasis. The caravan was resting,\r\n",
      "the camels were peacefully lying down; the palms stood all around in a\r\n",
      "complete circle; all the party were at dinner. But he was drinking water\r\n",
      "from a spring which flowed gurgling close by. And it was so cool, it was\r\n",
      "wonderful, wonderful, blue, cold water running among the parti-coloured\r\n",
      "stones and over the clean sand which glistened here and there like\r\n",
      "gold.... Suddenly he heard a clock strike. He started, roused himself,\r\n",
      "raised his head, looked out of the window, and seeing how late it was,\r\n",
      "suddenly jumped up wide awake as though someone had pulled him off the\r\n",
      "sofa. He crept on tiptoe to the door, stealthily opened it and began\r\n",
      "listening on the staircase. His heart beat terribly. But all was quiet\r\n",
      "on the stairs as if everyone was asleep.... It seemed to him strange and\r\n",
      "monstrous that he could have slept in such forgetfulness from the\r\n",
      "previous day and had done nothing, had prepared nothing yet.... And\r\n",
      "meanwhile perhaps it had struck six. And his drowsiness and stupefaction\r\n",
      "were followed by an extraordinary, feverish, as it were distracted\r\n",
      "haste. But the preparations to be made were few. He concentrated all his\r\n",
      "energies on thinking of everything and forgetting nothing; and his heart\r\n",
      "kept beating and thumping so that he could hardly breathe. First he had\r\n",
      "to make a noose and sew it into his overcoat--a work of a moment. He\r\n",
      "rummaged under his pillow and picked out amongst the linen stuffed away\r\n",
      "under it, a worn out, old unwashed shirt. From its rags he tore a long\r\n",
      "strip, a couple of inches wide and about sixteen inches long. He folded\r\n",
      "this strip in two, took off his wide, strong summer overcoat of some\r\n",
      "stout cotton material (his only outer garment) and began sewing the two\r\n",
      "ends of the rag on the inside, under the left armhole. His hands shook\r\n",
      "as he sewed, but he did it successfully so that nothing showed outside\r\n",
      "when he put the coat on again. The needle and thread he had got ready\r\n",
      "long before and they lay on his table in a piece of paper. As for the\r\n",
      "noose, it was a very ingenious device of his own; the noose was intended\r\n",
      "for the axe. It was impossible for him to carry the axe through the\r\n",
      "street in his hands. And if hidden under his coat he would still have\r\n",
      "had to support it with his hand, which would have been noticeable. Now\r\n",
      "he had only to put the head of the axe in the noose, and it would hang\r\n",
      "quietly under his arm on the inside. Putting his hand in his coat\r\n",
      "pocket, he could hold the end of the handle all the way, so that it did\r\n",
      "not swing; and as the coat was very full, a regular sack in fact, it\r\n",
      "could not be seen from outside that he was holding something with the\r\n",
      "hand that was in the pocket. This noose, too, he had designed a\r\n",
      "fortnight before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had finished with this, he thrust his hand into a little opening\r\n",
      "between his sofa and the floor, fumbled in the left corner and drew out\r\n",
      "the _pledge_, which he had got ready long before and hidden there. This\r\n",
      "pledge was, however, only a smoothly planed piece of wood the size and\r\n",
      "thickness of a silver cigarette case. He picked up this piece of wood\r\n",
      "in one of his wanderings in a courtyard where there was some sort of\r\n",
      "a workshop. Afterwards he had added to the wood a thin smooth piece\r\n",
      "of iron, which he had also picked up at the same time in the street.\r\n",
      "Putting the iron which was a little the smaller on the piece of wood,\r\n",
      "he fastened them very firmly, crossing and re-crossing the thread round\r\n",
      "them; then wrapped them carefully and daintily in clean white paper and\r\n",
      "tied up the parcel so that it would be very difficult to untie it. This\r\n",
      "was in order to divert the attention of the old woman for a time, while\r\n",
      "she was trying to undo the knot, and so to gain a moment. The iron strip\r\n",
      "was added to give weight, so that the woman might not guess the first\r\n",
      "minute that the “thing” was made of wood. All this had been stored by\r\n",
      "him beforehand under the sofa. He had only just got the pledge out when\r\n",
      "he heard someone suddenly about in the yard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It struck six long ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Long ago! My God!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rushed to the door, listened, caught up his hat and began to descend\r\n",
      "his thirteen steps cautiously, noiselessly, like a cat. He had still the\r\n",
      "most important thing to do--to steal the axe from the kitchen. That the\r\n",
      "deed must be done with an axe he had decided long ago. He had also a\r\n",
      "pocket pruning-knife, but he could not rely on the knife and still less\r\n",
      "on his own strength, and so resolved finally on the axe. We may note in\r\n",
      "passing, one peculiarity in regard to all the final resolutions taken by\r\n",
      "him in the matter; they had one strange characteristic: the more final\r\n",
      "they were, the more hideous and the more absurd they at once became in\r\n",
      "his eyes. In spite of all his agonising inward struggle, he never for\r\n",
      "a single instant all that time could believe in the carrying out of his\r\n",
      "plans.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, indeed, if it had ever happened that everything to the least point\r\n",
      "could have been considered and finally settled, and no uncertainty of\r\n",
      "any kind had remained, he would, it seems, have renounced it all\r\n",
      "as something absurd, monstrous and impossible. But a whole mass of\r\n",
      "unsettled points and uncertainties remained. As for getting the axe,\r\n",
      "that trifling business cost him no anxiety, for nothing could be easier.\r\n",
      "Nastasya was continually out of the house, especially in the evenings;\r\n",
      "she would run in to the neighbours or to a shop, and always left the\r\n",
      "door ajar. It was the one thing the landlady was always scolding her\r\n",
      "about. And so, when the time came, he would only have to go quietly into\r\n",
      "the kitchen and to take the axe, and an hour later (when everything\r\n",
      "was over) go in and put it back again. But these were doubtful points.\r\n",
      "Supposing he returned an hour later to put it back, and Nastasya had\r\n",
      "come back and was on the spot. He would of course have to go by and wait\r\n",
      "till she went out again. But supposing she were in the meantime to miss\r\n",
      "the axe, look for it, make an outcry--that would mean suspicion or at\r\n",
      "least grounds for suspicion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But those were all trifles which he had not even begun to consider, and\r\n",
      "indeed he had no time. He was thinking of the chief point, and put off\r\n",
      "trifling details, until _he could believe in it all_. But that seemed\r\n",
      "utterly unattainable. So it seemed to himself at least. He could not\r\n",
      "imagine, for instance, that he would sometime leave off thinking, get\r\n",
      "up and simply go there.... Even his late experiment (i.e. his visit with\r\n",
      "the object of a final survey of the place) was simply an attempt at\r\n",
      "an experiment, far from being the real thing, as though one should say\r\n",
      "“come, let us go and try it--why dream about it!”--and at once he\r\n",
      "had broken down and had run away cursing, in a frenzy with himself.\r\n",
      "Meanwhile it would seem, as regards the moral question, that his\r\n",
      "analysis was complete; his casuistry had become keen as a razor, and he\r\n",
      "could not find rational objections in himself. But in the last resort\r\n",
      "he simply ceased to believe in himself, and doggedly, slavishly sought\r\n",
      "arguments in all directions, fumbling for them, as though someone were\r\n",
      "forcing and drawing him to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At first--long before indeed--he had been much occupied with one\r\n",
      "question; why almost all crimes are so badly concealed and so easily\r\n",
      "detected, and why almost all criminals leave such obvious traces? He\r\n",
      "had come gradually to many different and curious conclusions, and in his\r\n",
      "opinion the chief reason lay not so much in the material impossibility\r\n",
      "of concealing the crime, as in the criminal himself. Almost every\r\n",
      "criminal is subject to a failure of will and reasoning power by a\r\n",
      "childish and phenomenal heedlessness, at the very instant when prudence\r\n",
      "and caution are most essential. It was his conviction that this eclipse\r\n",
      "of reason and failure of will power attacked a man like a disease,\r\n",
      "developed gradually and reached its highest point just before the\r\n",
      "perpetration of the crime, continued with equal violence at the moment\r\n",
      "of the crime and for longer or shorter time after, according to the\r\n",
      "individual case, and then passed off like any other disease. The\r\n",
      "question whether the disease gives rise to the crime, or whether the\r\n",
      "crime from its own peculiar nature is always accompanied by something of\r\n",
      "the nature of disease, he did not yet feel able to decide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he reached these conclusions, he decided that in his own case there\r\n",
      "could not be such a morbid reaction, that his reason and will would\r\n",
      "remain unimpaired at the time of carrying out his design, for the\r\n",
      "simple reason that his design was “not a crime....” We will omit all the\r\n",
      "process by means of which he arrived at this last conclusion; we have\r\n",
      "run too far ahead already.... We may add only that the practical, purely\r\n",
      "material difficulties of the affair occupied a secondary position in his\r\n",
      "mind. “One has but to keep all one’s will-power and reason to deal\r\n",
      "with them, and they will all be overcome at the time when once one has\r\n",
      "familiarised oneself with the minutest details of the business....” But\r\n",
      "this preparation had never been begun. His final decisions were what he\r\n",
      "came to trust least, and when the hour struck, it all came to pass quite\r\n",
      "differently, as it were accidentally and unexpectedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One trifling circumstance upset his calculations, before he had even\r\n",
      "left the staircase. When he reached the landlady’s kitchen, the door\r\n",
      "of which was open as usual, he glanced cautiously in to see whether, in\r\n",
      "Nastasya’s absence, the landlady herself was there, or if not, whether\r\n",
      "the door to her own room was closed, so that she might not peep out when\r\n",
      "he went in for the axe. But what was his amazement when he suddenly\r\n",
      "saw that Nastasya was not only at home in the kitchen, but was occupied\r\n",
      "there, taking linen out of a basket and hanging it on a line. Seeing\r\n",
      "him, she left off hanging the clothes, turned to him and stared at him\r\n",
      "all the time he was passing. He turned away his eyes, and walked past as\r\n",
      "though he noticed nothing. But it was the end of everything; he had not\r\n",
      "the axe! He was overwhelmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What made me think,” he reflected, as he went under the gateway, “what\r\n",
      "made me think that she would be sure not to be at home at that moment!\r\n",
      "Why, why, why did I assume this so certainly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was crushed and even humiliated. He could have laughed at himself in\r\n",
      "his anger.... A dull animal rage boiled within him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood hesitating in the gateway. To go into the street, to go a walk\r\n",
      "for appearance’ sake was revolting; to go back to his room, even more\r\n",
      "revolting. “And what a chance I have lost for ever!” he muttered,\r\n",
      "standing aimlessly in the gateway, just opposite the porter’s little\r\n",
      "dark room, which was also open. Suddenly he started. From the porter’s\r\n",
      "room, two paces away from him, something shining under the bench to the\r\n",
      "right caught his eye.... He looked about him--nobody. He approached the\r\n",
      "room on tiptoe, went down two steps into it and in a faint voice called\r\n",
      "the porter. “Yes, not at home! Somewhere near though, in the yard, for\r\n",
      "the door is wide open.” He dashed to the axe (it was an axe) and pulled\r\n",
      "it out from under the bench, where it lay between two chunks of wood;\r\n",
      "at once, before going out, he made it fast in the noose, he thrust both\r\n",
      "hands into his pockets and went out of the room; no one had noticed him!\r\n",
      "“When reason fails, the devil helps!” he thought with a strange grin.\r\n",
      "This chance raised his spirits extraordinarily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked along quietly and sedately, without hurry, to avoid awakening\r\n",
      "suspicion. He scarcely looked at the passers-by, tried to escape looking\r\n",
      "at their faces at all, and to be as little noticeable as possible.\r\n",
      "Suddenly he thought of his hat. “Good heavens! I had the money the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday and did not get a cap to wear instead!” A curse rose\r\n",
      "from the bottom of his soul.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Glancing out of the corner of his eye into a shop, he saw by a clock on\r\n",
      "the wall that it was ten minutes past seven. He had to make haste and at\r\n",
      "the same time to go someway round, so as to approach the house from the\r\n",
      "other side....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had happened to imagine all this beforehand, he had sometimes\r\n",
      "thought that he would be very much afraid. But he was not very much\r\n",
      "afraid now, was not afraid at all, indeed. His mind was even occupied\r\n",
      "by irrelevant matters, but by nothing for long. As he passed the Yusupov\r\n",
      "garden, he was deeply absorbed in considering the building of great\r\n",
      "fountains, and of their refreshing effect on the atmosphere in all\r\n",
      "the squares. By degrees he passed to the conviction that if the summer\r\n",
      "garden were extended to the field of Mars, and perhaps joined to the\r\n",
      "garden of the Mihailovsky Palace, it would be a splendid thing and a\r\n",
      "great benefit to the town. Then he was interested by the question why\r\n",
      "in all great towns men are not simply driven by necessity, but in some\r\n",
      "peculiar way inclined to live in those parts of the town where there\r\n",
      "are no gardens nor fountains; where there is most dirt and smell and all\r\n",
      "sorts of nastiness. Then his own walks through the Hay Market came back\r\n",
      "to his mind, and for a moment he waked up to reality. “What nonsense!”\r\n",
      " he thought, “better think of nothing at all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So probably men led to execution clutch mentally at every object that\r\n",
      "meets them on the way,” flashed through his mind, but simply flashed,\r\n",
      "like lightning; he made haste to dismiss this thought.... And by now\r\n",
      "he was near; here was the house, here was the gate. Suddenly a clock\r\n",
      "somewhere struck once. “What! can it be half-past seven? Impossible, it\r\n",
      "must be fast!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Luckily for him, everything went well again at the gates. At that very\r\n",
      "moment, as though expressly for his benefit, a huge waggon of hay had\r\n",
      "just driven in at the gate, completely screening him as he passed under\r\n",
      "the gateway, and the waggon had scarcely had time to drive through into\r\n",
      "the yard, before he had slipped in a flash to the right. On the other\r\n",
      "side of the waggon he could hear shouting and quarrelling; but no one\r\n",
      "noticed him and no one met him. Many windows looking into that huge\r\n",
      "quadrangular yard were open at that moment, but he did not raise his\r\n",
      "head--he had not the strength to. The staircase leading to the old\r\n",
      "woman’s room was close by, just on the right of the gateway. He was\r\n",
      "already on the stairs....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Drawing a breath, pressing his hand against his throbbing heart, and\r\n",
      "once more feeling for the axe and setting it straight, he began softly\r\n",
      "and cautiously ascending the stairs, listening every minute. But the\r\n",
      "stairs, too, were quite deserted; all the doors were shut; he met no\r\n",
      "one. One flat indeed on the first floor was wide open and painters were\r\n",
      "at work in it, but they did not glance at him. He stood still, thought\r\n",
      "a minute and went on. “Of course it would be better if they had not been\r\n",
      "here, but... it’s two storeys above them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And there was the fourth storey, here was the door, here was the\r\n",
      "flat opposite, the empty one. The flat underneath the old woman’s was\r\n",
      "apparently empty also; the visiting card nailed on the door had been\r\n",
      "torn off--they had gone away!... He was out of breath. For one instant\r\n",
      "the thought floated through his mind “Shall I go back?” But he made no\r\n",
      "answer and began listening at the old woman’s door, a dead silence. Then\r\n",
      "he listened again on the staircase, listened long and intently...\r\n",
      "then looked about him for the last time, pulled himself together, drew\r\n",
      "himself up, and once more tried the axe in the noose. “Am I very pale?”\r\n",
      " he wondered. “Am I not evidently agitated? She is mistrustful.... Had I\r\n",
      "better wait a little longer... till my heart leaves off thumping?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his heart did not leave off. On the contrary, as though to spite\r\n",
      "him, it throbbed more and more violently. He could stand it no longer,\r\n",
      "he slowly put out his hand to the bell and rang. Half a minute later he\r\n",
      "rang again, more loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No answer. To go on ringing was useless and out of place. The old woman\r\n",
      "was, of course, at home, but she was suspicious and alone. He had some\r\n",
      "knowledge of her habits... and once more he put his ear to the door.\r\n",
      "Either his senses were peculiarly keen (which it is difficult to\r\n",
      "suppose), or the sound was really very distinct. Anyway, he suddenly\r\n",
      "heard something like the cautious touch of a hand on the lock and the\r\n",
      "rustle of a skirt at the very door. Someone was standing stealthily\r\n",
      "close to the lock and just as he was doing on the outside was secretly\r\n",
      "listening within, and seemed to have her ear to the door.... He moved\r\n",
      "a little on purpose and muttered something aloud that he might not have\r\n",
      "the appearance of hiding, then rang a third time, but quietly, soberly,\r\n",
      "and without impatience, Recalling it afterwards, that moment stood out\r\n",
      "in his mind vividly, distinctly, for ever; he could not make out how he\r\n",
      "had had such cunning, for his mind was as it were clouded at moments and\r\n",
      "he was almost unconscious of his body.... An instant later he heard the\r\n",
      "latch unfastened.\r\n",

      "The door was as before opened a tiny crack, and again two sharp and\r\n",
      "suspicious eyes stared at him out of the darkness. Then Raskolnikov lost\r\n",
      "his head and nearly made a great mistake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fearing the old woman would be frightened by their being alone, and not\r\n",

      "in alarm, tried to say something, but seemed unable to speak and stared\r\n",
      "with open eyes at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good evening, Alyona Ivanovna,” he began, trying to speak easily, but\r\n",

      "brought something... but we’d better come in... to the light....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And leaving her, he passed straight into the room uninvited. The old\r\n",
      "woman ran after him; her tongue was unloosed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! What it is? Who is it? What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The old woman glanced for a moment at the pledge, but at once stared in\r\n",
      "the eyes of her uninvited visitor. She looked intently, maliciously and\r\n",
      "mistrustfully. A minute passed; he even fancied something like a sneer\r\n",
      "in her eyes, as though she had already guessed everything. He felt that\r\n",
      "he was losing his head, that he was almost frightened, so frightened\r\n",
      "that if she were to look like that and not say a word for another half\r\n",
      "minute, he thought he would have run away from her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you look at me as though you did not know me?” he said suddenly,\r\n",
      "also with malice. “Take it if you like, if not I’ll go elsewhere, I am\r\n",
      "in a hurry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not even thought of saying this, but it was suddenly said of\r\n",
      "itself. The old woman recovered herself, and her visitor’s resolute tone\r\n",
      "evidently restored her confidence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why, my good sir, all of a minute.... What is it?” she asked,\r\n",
      "looking at the pledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The silver cigarette case; I spoke of it last time, you know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She held out her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But how pale you are, to be sure... and your hands are trembling too?\r\n",
      "Have you been bathing, or what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fever,” he answered abruptly. “You can’t help getting pale... if you’ve\r\n",
      "nothing to eat,” he added, with difficulty articulating the words.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His strength was failing him again. But his answer sounded like the\r\n",
      "truth; the old woman took the pledge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” she asked once more, scanning Raskolnikov intently, and\r\n",
      "weighing the pledge in her hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A thing... cigarette case.... Silver.... Look at it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It does not seem somehow like silver.... How he has wrapped it up!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Trying to untie the string and turning to the window, to the light (all\r\n",
      "her windows were shut, in spite of the stifling heat), she left\r\n",
      "him altogether for some seconds and stood with her back to him. He\r\n",
      "unbuttoned his coat and freed the axe from the noose, but did not yet\r\n",
      "take it out altogether, simply holding it in his right hand under the\r\n",
      "coat. His hands were fearfully weak, he felt them every moment growing\r\n",
      "more numb and more wooden. He was afraid he would let the axe slip and\r\n",
      "fall.... A sudden giddiness came over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what has he tied it up like this for?” the old woman cried with\r\n",
      "vexation and moved towards him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not a minute more to lose. He pulled the axe quite out, swung\r\n",
      "it with both arms, scarcely conscious of himself, and almost without\r\n",
      "effort, almost mechanically, brought the blunt side down on her head. He\r\n",
      "seemed not to use his own strength in this. But as soon as he had once\r\n",
      "brought the axe down, his strength returned to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old woman was as always bareheaded. Her thin, light hair, streaked\r\n",
      "with grey, thickly smeared with grease, was plaited in a rat’s tail and\r\n",
      "fastened by a broken horn comb which stood out on the nape of her neck.\r\n",
      "As she was so short, the blow fell on the very top of her skull. She\r\n",
      "cried out, but very faintly, and suddenly sank all of a heap on the\r\n",
      "floor, raising her hands to her head. In one hand she still held “the\r\n",
      "pledge.” Then he dealt her another and another blow with the blunt side\r\n",
      "and on the same spot. The blood gushed as from an overturned glass, the\r\n",
      "body fell back. He stepped back, let it fall, and at once bent over her\r\n",
      "face; she was dead. Her eyes seemed to be starting out of their sockets,\r\n",
      "the brow and the whole face were drawn and contorted convulsively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid the axe on the ground near the dead body and felt at once in her\r\n",
      "pocket (trying to avoid the streaming body)--the same right-hand pocket\r\n",
      "from which she had taken the key on his last visit. He was in full\r\n",
      "possession of his faculties, free from confusion or giddiness, but his\r\n",
      "hands were still trembling. He remembered afterwards that he had been\r\n",
      "particularly collected and careful, trying all the time not to get\r\n",
      "smeared with blood.... He pulled out the keys at once, they were all,\r\n",
      "as before, in one bunch on a steel ring. He ran at once into the bedroom\r\n",
      "with them. It was a very small room with a whole shrine of holy images.\r\n",
      "Against the other wall stood a big bed, very clean and covered with\r\n",
      "a silk patchwork wadded quilt. Against a third wall was a chest of\r\n",
      "drawers. Strange to say, so soon as he began to fit the keys into the\r\n",
      "chest, so soon as he heard their jingling, a convulsive shudder passed\r\n",
      "over him. He suddenly felt tempted again to give it all up and go\r\n",
      "away. But that was only for an instant; it was too late to go back.\r\n",
      "He positively smiled at himself, when suddenly another terrifying idea\r\n",
      "occurred to his mind. He suddenly fancied that the old woman might be\r\n",
      "still alive and might recover her senses. Leaving the keys in the chest,\r\n",
      "he ran back to the body, snatched up the axe and lifted it once more\r\n",
      "over the old woman, but did not bring it down. There was no doubt that\r\n",
      "she was dead. Bending down and examining her again more closely, he saw\r\n",
      "clearly that the skull was broken and even battered in on one side. He\r\n",
      "was about to feel it with his finger, but drew back his hand and indeed\r\n",
      "it was evident without that. Meanwhile there was a perfect pool of\r\n",
      "blood. All at once he noticed a string on her neck; he tugged at it, but\r\n",
      "the string was strong and did not snap and besides, it was soaked\r\n",
      "with blood. He tried to pull it out from the front of the dress, but\r\n",
      "something held it and prevented its coming. In his impatience he raised\r\n",
      "the axe again to cut the string from above on the body, but did not\r\n",
      "dare, and with difficulty, smearing his hand and the axe in the blood,\r\n",
      "after two minutes’ hurried effort, he cut the string and took it off\r\n",
      "without touching the body with the axe; he was not mistaken--it was a\r\n",
      "purse. On the string were two crosses, one of Cyprus wood and one of\r\n",
      "copper, and an image in silver filigree, and with them a small greasy\r\n",
      "chamois leather purse with a steel rim and ring. The purse was stuffed\r\n",
      "very full; Raskolnikov thrust it in his pocket without looking at it,\r\n",
      "flung the crosses on the old woman’s body and rushed back into the\r\n",
      "bedroom, this time taking the axe with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was in terrible haste, he snatched the keys, and began trying them\r\n",
      "again. But he was unsuccessful. They would not fit in the locks. It\r\n",
      "was not so much that his hands were shaking, but that he kept making\r\n",
      "mistakes; though he saw for instance that a key was not the right one\r\n",
      "and would not fit, still he tried to put it in. Suddenly he remembered\r\n",
      "and realised that the big key with the deep notches, which was hanging\r\n",
      "there with the small keys could not possibly belong to the chest of\r\n",
      "drawers (on his last visit this had struck him), but to some strong box,\r\n",
      "and that everything perhaps was hidden in that box. He left the chest\r\n",
      "of drawers, and at once felt under the bedstead, knowing that old\r\n",
      "women usually keep boxes under their beds. And so it was; there was a\r\n",
      "good-sized box under the bed, at least a yard in length, with an arched\r\n",
      "lid covered with red leather and studded with steel nails. The notched\r\n",
      "key fitted at once and unlocked it. At the top, under a white sheet, was\r\n",
      "a coat of red brocade lined with hareskin; under it was a silk dress,\r\n",
      "then a shawl and it seemed as though there was nothing below but\r\n",
      "clothes. The first thing he did was to wipe his blood-stained hands on\r\n",
      "the red brocade. “It’s red, and on red blood will be less noticeable,”\r\n",
      " the thought passed through his mind; then he suddenly came to himself.\r\n",
      "“Good God, am I going out of my senses?” he thought with terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no sooner did he touch the clothes than a gold watch slipped from\r\n",
      "under the fur coat. He made haste to turn them all over. There turned\r\n",
      "out to be various articles made of gold among the clothes--probably\r\n",
      "all pledges, unredeemed or waiting to be redeemed--bracelets, chains,\r\n",
      "ear-rings, pins and such things. Some were in cases, others simply\r\n",
      "wrapped in newspaper, carefully and exactly folded, and tied round with\r\n",
      "tape. Without any delay, he began filling up the pockets of his trousers\r\n",
      "and overcoat without examining or undoing the parcels and cases; but he\r\n",
      "had not time to take many....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly heard steps in the room where the old woman lay. He stopped\r\n",
      "short and was still as death. But all was quiet, so it must have been\r\n",
      "his fancy. All at once he heard distinctly a faint cry, as though\r\n",
      "someone had uttered a low broken moan. Then again dead silence for\r\n",
      "a minute or two. He sat squatting on his heels by the box and waited\r\n",
      "holding his breath. Suddenly he jumped up, seized the axe and ran out of\r\n",
      "the bedroom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the middle of the room stood Lizaveta with a big bundle in her arms.\r\n",
      "She was gazing in stupefaction at her murdered sister, white as a sheet\r\n",
      "and seeming not to have the strength to cry out. Seeing him run out\r\n",
      "of the bedroom, she began faintly quivering all over, like a leaf, a\r\n",
      "shudder ran down her face; she lifted her hand, opened her mouth, but\r\n",
      "still did not scream. She began slowly backing away from him into the\r\n",
      "corner, staring intently, persistently at him, but still uttered no\r\n",
      "sound, as though she could not get breath to scream. He rushed at her\r\n",
      "with the axe; her mouth twitched piteously, as one sees babies’ mouths,\r\n",
      "when they begin to be frightened, stare intently at what frightens them\r\n",
      "and are on the point of screaming. And this hapless Lizaveta was so\r\n",
      "simple and had been so thoroughly crushed and scared that she did not\r\n",
      "even raise a hand to guard her face, though that was the most necessary\r\n",
      "and natural action at the moment, for the axe was raised over her face.\r\n",
      "She only put up her empty left hand, but not to her face, slowly holding\r\n",
      "it out before her as though motioning him away. The axe fell with the\r\n",
      "sharp edge just on the skull and split at one blow all the top of the\r\n",
      "head. She fell heavily at once. Raskolnikov completely lost his head,\r\n",
      "snatching up her bundle, dropped it again and ran into the entry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fear gained more and more mastery over him, especially after this\r\n",
      "second, quite unexpected murder. He longed to run away from the place\r\n",
      "as fast as possible. And if at that moment he had been capable of seeing\r\n",
      "and reasoning more correctly, if he had been able to realise all the\r\n",
      "difficulties of his position, the hopelessness, the hideousness and the\r\n",
      "absurdity of it, if he could have understood how many obstacles and,\r\n",
      "perhaps, crimes he had still to overcome or to commit, to get out of\r\n",
      "that place and to make his way home, it is very possible that he would\r\n",
      "have flung up everything, and would have gone to give himself up, and\r\n",
      "not from fear, but from simple horror and loathing of what he had\r\n",
      "done. The feeling of loathing especially surged up within him and grew\r\n",
      "stronger every minute. He would not now have gone to the box or even\r\n",
      "into the room for anything in the world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But a sort of blankness, even dreaminess, had begun by degrees to take\r\n",
      "possession of him; at moments he forgot himself, or rather, forgot what\r\n",
      "was of importance, and caught at trifles. Glancing, however, into the\r\n",
      "kitchen and seeing a bucket half full of water on a bench, he bethought\r\n",
      "him of washing his hands and the axe. His hands were sticky with blood.\r\n",
      "He dropped the axe with the blade in the water, snatched a piece of soap\r\n",
      "that lay in a broken saucer on the window, and began washing his hands\r\n",
      "in the bucket. When they were clean, he took out the axe, washed the\r\n",
      "blade and spent a long time, about three minutes, washing the wood where\r\n",
      "there were spots of blood rubbing them with soap. Then he wiped it all\r\n",
      "with some linen that was hanging to dry on a line in the kitchen and\r\n",
      "then he was a long while attentively examining the axe at the window.\r\n",
      "There was no trace left on it, only the wood was still damp. He\r\n",
      "carefully hung the axe in the noose under his coat. Then as far as was\r\n",
      "possible, in the dim light in the kitchen, he looked over his overcoat,\r\n",
      "his trousers and his boots. At the first glance there seemed to be\r\n",
      "nothing but stains on the boots. He wetted the rag and rubbed the boots.\r\n",
      "But he knew he was not looking thoroughly, that there might be something\r\n",
      "quite noticeable that he was overlooking. He stood in the middle of the\r\n",
      "room, lost in thought. Dark agonising ideas rose in his mind--the idea\r\n",
      "that he was mad and that at that moment he was incapable of reasoning,\r\n",
      "of protecting himself, that he ought perhaps to be doing something\r\n",
      "utterly different from what he was now doing. “Good God!” he muttered “I\r\n",
      "must fly, fly,” and he rushed into the entry. But here a shock of terror\r\n",
      "awaited him such as he had never known before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood and gazed and could not believe his eyes: the door, the outer\r\n",
      "door from the stairs, at which he had not long before waited and rung,\r\n",
      "was standing unfastened and at least six inches open. No lock, no bolt,\r\n",
      "all the time, all that time! The old woman had not shut it after him\r\n",
      "perhaps as a precaution. But, good God! Why, he had seen Lizaveta\r\n",
      "afterwards! And how could he, how could he have failed to reflect that\r\n",
      "she must have come in somehow! She could not have come through the wall!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He dashed to the door and fastened the latch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But no, the wrong thing again! I must get away, get away....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He unfastened the latch, opened the door and began listening on the\r\n",
      "staircase.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He listened a long time. Somewhere far away, it might be in the gateway,\r\n",
      "two voices were loudly and shrilly shouting, quarrelling and scolding.\r\n",
      "“What are they about?” He waited patiently. At last all was still, as\r\n",
      "though suddenly cut off; they had separated. He was meaning to go out,\r\n",
      "but suddenly, on the floor below, a door was noisily opened and someone\r\n",
      "began going downstairs humming a tune. “How is it they all make such\r\n",
      "a noise?” flashed through his mind. Once more he closed the door and\r\n",
      "waited. At last all was still, not a soul stirring. He was just taking a\r\n",
      "step towards the stairs when he heard fresh footsteps.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The steps sounded very far off, at the very bottom of the stairs, but\r\n",
      "he remembered quite clearly and distinctly that from the first sound he\r\n",
      "began for some reason to suspect that this was someone coming _there_,\r\n",
      "to the fourth floor, to the old woman. Why? Were the sounds somehow\r\n",
      "peculiar, significant? The steps were heavy, even and unhurried. Now\r\n",
      "_he_ had passed the first floor, now he was mounting higher, it was\r\n",
      "growing more and more distinct! He could hear his heavy breathing. And\r\n",
      "now the third storey had been reached. Coming here! And it seemed to\r\n",
      "him all at once that he was turned to stone, that it was like a dream\r\n",
      "in which one is being pursued, nearly caught and will be killed, and is\r\n",
      "rooted to the spot and cannot even move one’s arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last when the unknown was mounting to the fourth floor, he suddenly\r\n",
      "started, and succeeded in slipping neatly and quickly back into the\r\n",
      "flat and closing the door behind him. Then he took the hook and softly,\r\n",
      "noiselessly, fixed it in the catch. Instinct helped him. When he had\r\n",
      "done this, he crouched holding his breath, by the door. The unknown\r\n",
      "visitor was by now also at the door. They were now standing opposite one\r\n",
      "another, as he had just before been standing with the old woman, when\r\n",
      "the door divided them and he was listening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor panted several times. “He must be a big, fat man,” thought\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, squeezing the axe in his hand. It seemed like a dream\r\n",
      "indeed. The visitor took hold of the bell and rang it loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as the tin bell tinkled, Raskolnikov seemed to be aware of\r\n",
      "something moving in the room. For some seconds he listened quite\r\n",
      "seriously. The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently\r\n",
      "and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror\r\n",
      "at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every\r\n",
      "minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem\r\n",
      "possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the\r\n",
      "fastening, but _he_ might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him\r\n",
      "again. “I shall fall down!” flashed through his mind, but the unknown\r\n",
      "began to speak and he recovered himself at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!” he bawled in a\r\n",
      "thick voice, “Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey,\r\n",
      "my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And again, enraged, he tugged with all his might a dozen times at\r\n",
      "the bell. He must certainly be a man of authority and an intimate\r\n",
      "acquaintance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At this moment light hurried steps were heard not far off, on the\r\n",
      "stairs. Someone else was approaching. Raskolnikov had not heard them at\r\n",
      "first.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t say there’s no one at home,” the new-comer cried in a\r\n",
      "cheerful, ringing voice, addressing the first visitor, who still went on\r\n",
      "pulling the bell. “Good evening, Koch.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From his voice he must be quite young,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who the devil can tell? I’ve almost broken the lock,” answered Koch.\r\n",
      "“But how do you come to know me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why! The day before yesterday I beat you three times running at\r\n",
      "billiards at Gambrinus’.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So they are not at home? That’s queer. It’s awfully stupid though.\r\n",
      "Where could the old woman have gone? I’ve come on business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; and I have business with her, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what can we do? Go back, I suppose, Aie--aie! And I was hoping to\r\n",
      "get some money!” cried the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The\r\n",
      "old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It’s out of my way.\r\n",
      "And where the devil she can have got to, I can’t make out. She sits here\r\n",
      "from year’s end to year’s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet\r\n",
      "here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hadn’t we better ask the porter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where she’s gone and when she’ll be back.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go\r\n",
      "anywhere.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he once more tugged at the door-handle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Damn it all. There’s nothing to be done, we must go!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay!” cried the young man suddenly. “Do you see how the door shakes if\r\n",
      "you pull it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That shows it’s not locked, but fastened with the hook! Do you hear how\r\n",
      "the hook clanks?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, don’t you see? That proves that one of them is at home. If they\r\n",
      "were all out, they would have locked the door from the outside with the\r\n",
      "key and not with the hook from inside. There, do you hear how the hook\r\n",
      "is clanking? To fasten the hook on the inside they must be at home,\r\n",
      "don’t you see. So there they are sitting inside and don’t open the\r\n",
      "door!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well! And so they must be!” cried Koch, astonished. “What are they\r\n",
      "about in there?” And he began furiously shaking the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay!” cried the young man again. “Don’t pull at it! There must be\r\n",
      "something wrong.... Here, you’ve been ringing and pulling at the door\r\n",
      "and still they don’t open! So either they’ve both fainted or...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you what. Let’s go fetch the porter, let him wake them up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both were going down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay. You stop here while I run down for the porter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you’d better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m studying the law you see! It’s evident, e-vi-dent there’s something\r\n",
      "wrong here!” the young man cried hotly, and he ran downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Koch remained. Once more he softly touched the bell which gave one\r\n",
      "tinkle, then gently, as though reflecting and looking about him, began\r\n",
      "touching the door-handle pulling it and letting it go to make sure once\r\n",
      "more that it was only fastened by the hook. Then puffing and panting he\r\n",
      "bent down and began looking at the keyhole: but the key was in the lock\r\n",
      "on the inside and so nothing could be seen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov stood keeping tight hold of the axe. He was in a sort of\r\n",
      "delirium. He was even making ready to fight when they should come in.\r\n",
      "While they were knocking and talking together, the idea several times\r\n",
      "occurred to him to end it all at once and shout to them through the\r\n",
      "door. Now and then he was tempted to swear at them, to jeer at them,\r\n",
      "while they could not open the door! “Only make haste!” was the thought\r\n",
      "that flashed through his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what the devil is he about?...” Time was passing, one minute, and\r\n",
      "another--no one came. Koch began to be restless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What the devil?” he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his\r\n",
      "sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy\r\n",
      "boots on the stairs. The steps died away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! What am I to do?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door--there was no sound.\r\n",
      "Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as\r\n",
      "thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice\r\n",
      "below--where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going\r\n",
      "back to the flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hey there! Catch the brute!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran\r\n",
      "down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Mitka! Blast him!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The shout ended in a shriek; the last sounds came from the yard; all was\r\n",
      "still. But at the same instant several men talking loud and fast began\r\n",
      "noisily mounting the stairs. There were three or four of them. He\r\n",
      "distinguished the ringing voice of the young man. “Hey!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Filled with despair he went straight to meet them, feeling “come what\r\n",
      "must!” If they stopped him--all was lost; if they let him pass--all was\r\n",
      "lost too; they would remember him. They were approaching; they were only\r\n",
      "a flight from him--and suddenly deliverance! A few steps from him on the\r\n",
      "right, there was an empty flat with the door wide open, the flat on the\r\n",
      "second floor where the painters had been at work, and which, as though\r\n",
      "for his benefit, they had just left. It was they, no doubt, who had just\r\n",
      "run down, shouting. The floor had only just been painted, in the middle\r\n",
      "of the room stood a pail and a broken pot with paint and brushes. In one\r\n",
      "instant he had whisked in at the open door and hidden behind the wall\r\n",
      "and only in the nick of time; they had already reached the landing.\r\n",
      "Then they turned and went on up to the fourth floor, talking loudly. He\r\n",
      "waited, went out on tiptoe and ran down the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one was on the stairs, nor in the gateway. He passed quickly through\r\n",
      "the gateway and turned to the left in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knew, he knew perfectly well that at that moment they were at the\r\n",
      "flat, that they were greatly astonished at finding it unlocked, as\r\n",
      "the door had just been fastened, that by now they were looking at the\r\n",
      "bodies, that before another minute had passed they would guess and\r\n",
      "completely realise that the murderer had just been there, and had\r\n",
      "succeeded in hiding somewhere, slipping by them and escaping. They would\r\n",
      "guess most likely that he had been in the empty flat, while they were\r\n",
      "going upstairs. And meanwhile he dared not quicken his pace much, though\r\n",
      "the next turning was still nearly a hundred yards away. “Should he\r\n",
      "slip through some gateway and wait somewhere in an unknown street? No,\r\n",
      "hopeless! Should he fling away the axe? Should he take a cab? Hopeless,\r\n",
      "hopeless!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last he reached the turning. He turned down it more dead than alive.\r\n",
      "Here he was half way to safety, and he understood it; it was less risky\r\n",
      "because there was a great crowd of people, and he was lost in it like a\r\n",
      "grain of sand. But all he had suffered had so weakened him that he could\r\n",
      "scarcely move. Perspiration ran down him in drops, his neck was all wet.\r\n",
      "“My word, he has been going it!” someone shouted at him when he came out\r\n",
      "on the canal bank.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was only dimly conscious of himself now, and the farther he went the\r\n",
      "worse it was. He remembered however, that on coming out on to the canal\r\n",
      "bank, he was alarmed at finding few people there and so being more\r\n",
      "conspicuous, and he had thought of turning back. Though he was almost\r\n",
      "falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from\r\n",
      "quite a different direction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his\r\n",
      "house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe.\r\n",
      "And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to\r\n",
      "escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course\r\n",
      "incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to\r\n",
      "restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody’s yard. But\r\n",
      "it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter’s room was closed\r\n",
      "but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at\r\n",
      "home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he\r\n",
      "walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him,\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe. But\r\n",
      "again the porter was not at home, and he succeeded in putting the axe\r\n",
      "back under the bench, and even covering it with the chunk of wood as\r\n",
      "before. He met no one, not a soul, afterwards on the way to his room;\r\n",
      "the landlady’s door was shut. When he was in his room, he flung himself\r\n",
      "on the sofa just as he was--he did not sleep, but sank into blank\r\n",
      "forgetfulness. If anyone had come into his room then, he would have\r\n",
      "jumped up at once and screamed. Scraps and shreds of thoughts were\r\n",
      "simply swarming in his brain, but he could not catch at one, he could\r\n",
      "not rest on one, in spite of all his efforts....\r\n",

      "Fearful, despairing cries rose shrilly from the street, sounds which he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "For the first moment he thought he was going mad. A dreadful chill came\r\n",
      "over him; but the chill was from the fever that had begun long before in\r\n",
      "his sleep. Now he was suddenly taken with violent shivering, so that his\r\n",
      "teeth chattered and all his limbs were shaking. He opened the door and\r\n",
      "began listening--everything in the house was asleep. With amazement he\r\n",
      "gazed at himself and everything in the room around him, wondering how he\r\n",
      "could have come in the night before without fastening the door, and have\r\n",
      "flung himself on the sofa without undressing, without even taking his\r\n",
      "hat off. It had fallen off and was lying on the floor near his pillow.\r\n",

      "but...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rushed to the window. There was light enough, and he began hurriedly\r\n",
      "looking himself all over from head to foot, all his clothes; were there\r\n",
      "no traces? But there was no doing it like that; shivering with cold, he\r\n",
      "began taking off everything and looking over again. He turned everything\r\n",
      "over to the last threads and rags, and mistrusting himself, went through\r\n",
      "his search three times.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "some thick drops of congealed blood were clinging to the frayed edge\r\n",
      "of his trousers. He picked up a big claspknife and cut off the frayed\r\n",
      "threads. There seemed to be nothing more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly he remembered that the purse and the things he had taken out of\r\n",

      "then of taking them out and hiding them! He had not even thought of them\r\n",
      "while he was examining his clothes! What next? Instantly he rushed\r\n",
      "to take them out and fling them on the table. When he had pulled out\r\n",
      "everything, and turned the pocket inside out to be sure there was\r\n",
      "nothing left, he carried the whole heap to the corner. The paper had\r\n",
      "come off the bottom of the wall and hung there in tatters. He began\r\n",
      "stuffing all the things into the hole under the paper: “They’re in! All\r\n",
      "out of sight, and the purse too!” he thought gleefully, getting up and\r\n",
      "gazing blankly at the hole which bulged out more than ever. Suddenly\r\n",

      "He sat down on the sofa in exhaustion and was at once shaken by another\r\n",
      "unbearable fit of shivering. Mechanically he drew from a chair beside\r\n",
      "him his old student’s winter coat, which was still warm though almost in\r\n",
      "rags, covered himself up with it and once more sank into drowsiness and\r\n",
      "delirium. He lost consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Not more than five minutes had passed when he jumped up a second time,\r\n",
      "and at once pounced in a frenzy on his clothes again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How could I go to sleep again with nothing done? Yes, yes; I have not\r\n",
      "taken the loop off the armhole! I forgot it, forgot a thing like that!\r\n",
      "Such a piece of evidence!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pulled off the noose, hurriedly cut it to pieces and threw the bits\r\n",
      "among his linen under the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pieces of torn linen couldn’t rouse suspicion, whatever happened; I\r\n",
      "think not, I think not, any way!” he repeated, standing in the middle\r\n",
      "of the room, and with painful concentration he fell to gazing about\r\n",
      "him again, at the floor and everywhere, trying to make sure he had not\r\n",
      "forgotten anything. The conviction that all his faculties, even memory,\r\n",
      "and the simplest power of reflection were failing him, began to be an\r\n",
      "insufferable torture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Surely it isn’t beginning already! Surely it isn’t my punishment coming\r\n",
      "upon me? It is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The frayed rags he had cut off his trousers were actually lying on the\r\n",
      "floor in the middle of the room, where anyone coming in would see them!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the matter with me!” he cried again, like one distraught.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then a strange idea entered his head; that, perhaps, all his clothes\r\n",
      "were covered with blood, that, perhaps, there were a great many\r\n",
      "stains, but that he did not see them, did not notice them because\r\n",
      "his perceptions were failing, were going to pieces... his reason was\r\n",
      "clouded.... Suddenly he remembered that there had been blood on the\r\n",
      "purse too. “Ah! Then there must be blood on the pocket too, for I put\r\n",
      "the wet purse in my pocket!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a flash he had turned the pocket inside out and, yes!--there were\r\n",
      "traces, stains on the lining of the pocket!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So my reason has not quite deserted me, so I still have some sense and\r\n",
      "memory, since I guessed it of myself,” he thought triumphantly, with\r\n",
      "a deep sigh of relief; “it’s simply the weakness of fever, a moment’s\r\n",
      "delirium,” and he tore the whole lining out of the left pocket of his\r\n",
      "trousers. At that instant the sunlight fell on his left boot; on the\r\n",
      "sock which poked out from the boot, he fancied there were traces! He\r\n",
      "flung off his boots; “traces indeed! The tip of the sock was soaked with\r\n",
      "blood;” he must have unwarily stepped into that pool.... “But what am I\r\n",
      "to do with this now? Where am I to put the sock and rags and pocket?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gathered them all up in his hands and stood in the middle of the\r\n",
      "room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the stove? But they would ransack the stove first of all. Burn them?\r\n",
      "But what can I burn them with? There are no matches even. No, better\r\n",
      "go out and throw it all away somewhere. Yes, better throw it away,” he\r\n",
      "repeated, sitting down on the sofa again, “and at once, this minute,\r\n",
      "without lingering...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his head sank on the pillow instead. Again the unbearable icy\r\n",
      "shivering came over him; again he drew his coat over him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And for a long while, for some hours, he was haunted by the impulse to\r\n",
      "“go off somewhere at once, this moment, and fling it all away, so that\r\n",
      "it may be out of sight and done with, at once, at once!” Several times\r\n",
      "he tried to rise from the sofa, but could not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was thoroughly waked up at last by a violent knocking at his door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Open, do, are you dead or alive? He keeps sleeping here!” shouted\r\n",
      "Nastasya, banging with her fist on the door. “For whole days together\r\n",
      "he’s snoring here like a dog! A dog he is too. Open I tell you. It’s\r\n",
      "past ten.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe he’s not at home,” said a man’s voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ha! that’s the porter’s voice.... What does he want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He jumped up and sat on the sofa. The beating of his heart was a\r\n",
      "positive pain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then who can have latched the door?” retorted Nastasya. “He’s taken to\r\n",
      "bolting himself in! As if he were worth stealing! Open, you stupid, wake\r\n",
      "up!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do they want? Why the porter? All’s discovered. Resist or open?\r\n",
      "Come what may!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He half rose, stooped forward and unlatched the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His room was so small that he could undo the latch without leaving the\r\n",
      "bed. Yes; the porter and Nastasya were standing there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya stared at him in a strange way. He glanced with a defiant and\r\n",
      "desperate air at the porter, who without a word held out a grey folded\r\n",
      "paper sealed with bottle-wax.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A notice from the office,” he announced, as he gave him the paper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“From what office?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A summons to the police office, of course. You know which office.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To the police?... What for?...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can I tell? You’re sent for, so you go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man looked at him attentively, looked round the room and turned to\r\n",
      "go away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s downright ill!” observed Nastasya, not taking her eyes off him.\r\n",
      "The porter turned his head for a moment. “He’s been in a fever since\r\n",
      "yesterday,” she added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov made no response and held the paper in his hands, without\r\n",
      "opening it. “Don’t you get up then,” Nastasya went on compassionately,\r\n",
      "seeing that he was letting his feet down from the sofa. “You’re ill, and\r\n",
      "so don’t go; there’s no such hurry. What have you got there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked; in his right hand he held the shreds he had cut from his\r\n",
      "trousers, the sock, and the rags of the pocket. So he had been asleep\r\n",
      "with them in his hand. Afterwards reflecting upon it, he remembered that\r\n",
      "half waking up in his fever, he had grasped all this tightly in his hand\r\n",
      "and so fallen asleep again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look at the rags he’s collected and sleeps with them, as though he has\r\n",
      "got hold of a treasure...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Nastasya went off into her hysterical giggle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instantly he thrust them all under his great coat and fixed his\r\n",
      "eyes intently upon her. Far as he was from being capable of rational\r\n",
      "reflection at that moment, he felt that no one would behave like that\r\n",
      "with a person who was going to be arrested. “But... the police?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’d better have some tea! Yes? I’ll bring it, there’s some left.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No... I’m going; I’ll go at once,” he muttered, getting on to his feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you’ll never get downstairs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I’ll go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As you please.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She followed the porter out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At once he rushed to the light to examine the sock and the rags.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are stains, but not very noticeable; all covered with dirt,\r\n",
      "and rubbed and already discoloured. No one who had no suspicion could\r\n",
      "distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed,\r\n",
      "thank God!” Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began\r\n",
      "reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood. It was an\r\n",
      "ordinary summons from the district police-station to appear that day at\r\n",
      "half-past nine at the office of the district superintendent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But when has such a thing happened? I never have anything to do with\r\n",
      "the police! And why just to-day?” he thought in agonising bewilderment.\r\n",
      "“Good God, only get it over soon!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was flinging himself on his knees to pray, but broke into\r\n",
      "laughter--not at the idea of prayer, but at himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began, hurriedly dressing. “If I’m lost, I am lost, I don’t care!\r\n",
      "Shall I put the sock on?” he suddenly wondered, “it will get dustier\r\n",
      "still and the traces will be gone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But no sooner had he put it on than he pulled it off again in loathing\r\n",
      "and horror. He pulled it off, but reflecting that he had no other socks,\r\n",
      "he picked it up and put it on again--and again he laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all conventional, that’s all relative, merely a way of looking\r\n",
      "at it,” he thought in a flash, but only on the top surface of his\r\n",
      "mind, while he was shuddering all over, “there, I’ve got it on! I have\r\n",
      "finished by getting it on!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his laughter was quickly followed by despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it’s too much for me...” he thought. His legs shook. “From fear,”\r\n",
      " he muttered. His head swam and ached with fever. “It’s a trick! They\r\n",
      "want to decoy me there and confound me over everything,” he mused, as\r\n",
      "he went out on to the stairs--“the worst of it is I’m almost\r\n",
      "light-headed... I may blurt out something stupid...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the stairs he remembered that he was leaving all the things just as\r\n",
      "they were in the hole in the wall, “and very likely, it’s on purpose\r\n",
      "to search when I’m out,” he thought, and stopped short. But he was\r\n",
      "possessed by such despair, such cynicism of misery, if one may so call\r\n",
      "it, that with a wave of his hand he went on. “Only to get it over!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the street the heat was insufferable again; not a drop of rain had\r\n",
      "fallen all those days. Again dust, bricks and mortar, again the stench\r\n",
      "from the shops and pot-houses, again the drunken men, the Finnish\r\n",
      "pedlars and half-broken-down cabs. The sun shone straight in his eyes,\r\n",
      "so that it hurt him to look out of them, and he felt his head going\r\n",
      "round--as a man in a fever is apt to feel when he comes out into the\r\n",
      "street on a bright sunny day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he reached the turning into _the_ street, in an agony of\r\n",
      "trepidation he looked down it... at _the_ house... and at once averted\r\n",
      "his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If they question me, perhaps I’ll simply tell,” he thought, as he drew\r\n",
      "near the police-station.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The police-station was about a quarter of a mile off. It had lately been\r\n",
      "moved to new rooms on the fourth floor of a new house. He had been once\r\n",
      "for a moment in the old office but long ago. Turning in at the gateway,\r\n",
      "he saw on the right a flight of stairs which a peasant was mounting with\r\n",
      "a book in his hand. “A house-porter, no doubt; so then, the office is\r\n",
      "here,” and he began ascending the stairs on the chance. He did not want\r\n",
      "to ask questions of anyone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll go in, fall on my knees, and confess everything...” he thought, as\r\n",
      "he reached the fourth floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The staircase was steep, narrow and all sloppy with dirty water. The\r\n",
      "kitchens of the flats opened on to the stairs and stood open almost\r\n",
      "the whole day. So there was a fearful smell and heat. The staircase\r\n",
      "was crowded with porters going up and down with their books under their\r\n",
      "arms, policemen, and persons of all sorts and both sexes. The door of\r\n",
      "the office, too, stood wide open. Peasants stood waiting within. There,\r\n",
      "too, the heat was stifling and there was a sickening smell of fresh\r\n",
      "paint and stale oil from the newly decorated rooms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After waiting a little, he decided to move forward into the next room.\r\n",
      "All the rooms were small and low-pitched. A fearful impatience drew him\r\n",
      "on and on. No one paid attention to him. In the second room some\r\n",
      "clerks sat writing, dressed hardly better than he was, and rather a\r\n",
      "queer-looking set. He went up to one of them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He showed the notice he had received.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a student?” the man asked, glancing at the notice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, formerly a student.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clerk looked at him, but without the slightest interest. He was a\r\n",
      "particularly unkempt person with the look of a fixed idea in his eye.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There would be no getting anything out of him, because he has no\r\n",
      "interest in anything,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go in there to the head clerk,” said the clerk, pointing towards the\r\n",
      "furthest room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went into that room--the fourth in order; it was a small room and\r\n",
      "packed full of people, rather better dressed than in the outer rooms.\r\n",
      "Among them were two ladies. One, poorly dressed in mourning, sat at the\r\n",
      "table opposite the chief clerk, writing something at his dictation.\r\n",
      "The other, a very stout, buxom woman with a purplish-red, blotchy face,\r\n",
      "excessively smartly dressed with a brooch on her bosom as big as a\r\n",
      "saucer, was standing on one side, apparently waiting for something.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov thrust his notice upon the head clerk. The latter glanced\r\n",
      "at it, said: “Wait a minute,” and went on attending to the lady in\r\n",
      "mourning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He breathed more freely. “It can’t be that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By degrees he began to regain confidence, he kept urging himself to have\r\n",
      "courage and be calm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some foolishness, some trifling carelessness, and I may betray myself!\r\n",
      "Hm... it’s a pity there’s no air here,” he added, “it’s stifling.... It\r\n",
      "makes one’s head dizzier than ever... and one’s mind too...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was conscious of a terrible inner turmoil. He was afraid of losing\r\n",
      "his self-control; he tried to catch at something and fix his mind on it,\r\n",
      "something quite irrelevant, but he could not succeed in this at all. Yet\r\n",
      "the head clerk greatly interested him, he kept hoping to see through him\r\n",
      "and guess something from his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was a very young man, about two and twenty, with a dark mobile\r\n",
      "face that looked older than his years. He was fashionably dressed and\r\n",
      "foppish, with his hair parted in the middle, well combed and pomaded,\r\n",
      "and wore a number of rings on his well-scrubbed fingers and a gold chain\r\n",
      "on his waistcoat. He said a couple of words in French to a foreigner who\r\n",
      "was in the room, and said them fairly correctly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Luise Ivanovna, you can sit down,” he said casually to the\r\n",
      "gaily-dressed, purple-faced lady, who was still standing as though not\r\n",
      "venturing to sit down, though there was a chair beside her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ich danke,” said the latter, and softly, with a rustle of silk she sank\r\n",
      "into the chair. Her light blue dress trimmed with white lace floated\r\n",
      "about the table like an air-balloon and filled almost half the room. She\r\n",
      "smelt of scent. But she was obviously embarrassed at filling half\r\n",
      "the room and smelling so strongly of scent; and though her smile was\r\n",
      "impudent as well as cringing, it betrayed evident uneasiness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady in mourning had done at last, and got up. All at once, with\r\n",
      "some noise, an officer walked in very jauntily, with a peculiar swing of\r\n",
      "his shoulders at each step. He tossed his cockaded cap on the table and\r\n",
      "sat down in an easy-chair. The small lady positively skipped from her\r\n",
      "seat on seeing him, and fell to curtsying in a sort of ecstasy; but the\r\n",
      "officer took not the smallest notice of her, and she did not venture to\r\n",
      "sit down again in his presence. He was the assistant superintendent. He\r\n",
      "had a reddish moustache that stood out horizontally on each side of his\r\n",
      "face, and extremely small features, expressive of nothing much except\r\n",
      "a certain insolence. He looked askance and rather indignantly at\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov; he was so very badly dressed, and in spite of his\r\n",
      "humiliating position, his bearing was by no means in keeping with his\r\n",
      "clothes. Raskolnikov had unwarily fixed a very long and direct look on\r\n",
      "him, so that he felt positively affronted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” he shouted, apparently astonished that such a ragged\r\n",
      "fellow was not annihilated by the majesty of his glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was summoned... by a notice...” Raskolnikov faltered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For the recovery of money due, from _the student_,” the head clerk\r\n",
      "interfered hurriedly, tearing himself from his papers. “Here!” and he\r\n",
      "flung Raskolnikov a document and pointed out the place. “Read that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Money? What money?” thought Raskolnikov, “but... then... it’s certainly\r\n",
      "not _that_.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he trembled with joy. He felt sudden intense indescribable relief. A\r\n",
      "load was lifted from his back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And pray, what time were you directed to appear, sir?” shouted the\r\n",
      "assistant superintendent, seeming for some unknown reason more and more\r\n",
      "aggrieved. “You are told to come at nine, and now it’s twelve!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The notice was only brought me a quarter of an hour ago,” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "answered loudly over his shoulder. To his own surprise he, too, grew\r\n",
      "suddenly angry and found a certain pleasure in it. “And it’s enough that\r\n",
      "I have come here ill with fever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Kindly refrain from shouting!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’m not shouting, I’m speaking very quietly, it’s you who are shouting\r\n",
      "at me. I’m a student, and allow no one to shout at me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The assistant superintendent was so furious that for the first minute he\r\n",
      "could only splutter inarticulately. He leaped up from his seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent! You are in a government office. Don’t be impudent, sir!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re in a government office, too,” cried Raskolnikov, “and you’re\r\n",
      "smoking a cigarette as well as shouting, so you are showing disrespect\r\n",
      "to all of us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt an indescribable satisfaction at having said this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The head clerk looked at him with a smile. The angry assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent was obviously disconcerted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s not your business!” he shouted at last with unnatural loudness.\r\n",
      "“Kindly make the declaration demanded of you. Show him. Alexandr\r\n",
      "Grigorievitch. There is a complaint against you! You don’t pay your\r\n",
      "debts! You’re a fine bird!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Raskolnikov was not listening now; he had eagerly clutched at the\r\n",
      "paper, in haste to find an explanation. He read it once, and a second\r\n",
      "time, and still did not understand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is this?” he asked the head clerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is for the recovery of money on an I O U, a writ. You must\r\n",
      "either pay it, with all expenses, costs and so on, or give a written\r\n",
      "declaration when you can pay it, and at the same time an undertaking not\r\n",
      "to leave the capital without payment, and nor to sell or conceal your\r\n",
      "property. The creditor is at liberty to sell your property, and proceed\r\n",
      "against you according to the law.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I... am not in debt to anyone!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s not our business. Here, an I O U for a hundred and fifteen\r\n",
      "roubles, legally attested, and due for payment, has been brought us\r\n",
      "for recovery, given by you to the widow of the assessor Zarnitsyn, nine\r\n",
      "months ago, and paid over by the widow Zarnitsyn to one Mr. Tchebarov.\r\n",
      "We therefore summon you, hereupon.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But she is my landlady!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what if she is your landlady?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The head clerk looked at him with a condescending smile of compassion,\r\n",
      "and at the same time with a certain triumph, as at a novice under fire\r\n",
      "for the first time--as though he would say: “Well, how do you feel now?”\r\n",
      " But what did he care now for an I O U, for a writ of recovery! Was that\r\n",
      "worth worrying about now, was it worth attention even! He stood, he\r\n",
      "read, he listened, he answered, he even asked questions himself, but\r\n",
      "all mechanically. The triumphant sense of security, of deliverance from\r\n",
      "overwhelming danger, that was what filled his whole soul that moment\r\n",
      "without thought for the future, without analysis, without suppositions\r\n",
      "or surmises, without doubts and without questioning. It was an instant\r\n",
      "of full, direct, purely instinctive joy. But at that very moment\r\n",
      "something like a thunderstorm took place in the office. The assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent, still shaken by Raskolnikov’s disrespect, still fuming\r\n",
      "and obviously anxious to keep up his wounded dignity, pounced on the\r\n",
      "unfortunate smart lady, who had been gazing at him ever since he came in\r\n",
      "with an exceedingly silly smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You shameful hussy!” he shouted suddenly at the top of his voice. (The\r\n",
      "lady in mourning had left the office.) “What was going on at your house\r\n",
      "last night? Eh! A disgrace again, you’re a scandal to the whole street.\r\n",
      "Fighting and drinking again. Do you want the house of correction? Why,\r\n",
      "I have warned you ten times over that I would not let you off the\r\n",
      "eleventh! And here you are again, again, you... you...!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The paper fell out of Raskolnikov’s hands, and he looked wildly at the\r\n",
      "smart lady who was so unceremoniously treated. But he soon saw what it\r\n",
      "meant, and at once began to find positive amusement in the scandal. He\r\n",
      "listened with pleasure, so that he longed to laugh and laugh... all his\r\n",
      "nerves were on edge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk was beginning anxiously, but stopped\r\n",
      "short, for he knew from experience that the enraged assistant could not\r\n",
      "be stopped except by force.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the smart lady, at first she positively trembled before the\r\n",
      "storm. But, strange to say, the more numerous and violent the terms of\r\n",
      "abuse became, the more amiable she looked, and the more seductive the\r\n",
      "smiles she lavished on the terrible assistant. She moved uneasily, and\r\n",
      "curtsied incessantly, waiting impatiently for a chance of putting in her\r\n",
      "word: and at last she found it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,” she\r\n",
      "pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently,\r\n",
      "though with a strong German accent, “and no sort of scandal, and his\r\n",
      "honour came drunk, and it’s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any\r\n",
      "scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles\r\n",
      "again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte\r\n",
      "with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and\r\n",
      "he _ganz_ broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said\r\n",
      "so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it. And then\r\n",
      "I called the porter, and Karl came, and he took Karl and hit him in the\r\n",
      "eye; and he hit Henriette in the eye, too, and gave me five slaps on the\r\n",
      "cheek. And it was so ungentlemanly in an honourable house, Mr. Captain,\r\n",
      "and I screamed. And he opened the window over the canal, and stood in\r\n",
      "the window, squealing like a little pig; it was a disgrace. The idea of\r\n",
      "squealing like a little pig at the window into the street! Fie upon him!\r\n",
      "And Karl pulled him away from the window by his coat, and it is true,\r\n",
      "Mr. Captain, he tore _sein rock_. And then he shouted that _man muss_\r\n",
      "pay him fifteen roubles damages. And I did pay him, Mr. Captain, five\r\n",
      "roubles for _sein rock_. And he is an ungentlemanly visitor and caused\r\n",
      "all the scandal. ‘I will show you up,’ he said, ‘for I can write to all\r\n",
      "the papers about you.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then he was an author?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Mr. Captain, and what an ungentlemanly visitor in an honourable\r\n",
      "house....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now then! Enough! I have told you already...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ilya Petrovitch!” the head clerk repeated significantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The assistant glanced rapidly at him; the head clerk slightly shook his\r\n",
      "head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“... So I tell you this, most respectable Luise Ivanovna, and I tell it\r\n",
      "you for the last time,” the assistant went on. “If there is a scandal\r\n",
      "in your honourable house once again, I will put you yourself in the\r\n",
      "lock-up, as it is called in polite society. Do you hear? So a literary\r\n",
      "man, an author took five roubles for his coat-tail in an ‘honourable\r\n",
      "house’? A nice set, these authors!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he cast a contemptuous glance at Raskolnikov. “There was a scandal\r\n",
      "the other day in a restaurant, too. An author had eaten his dinner and\r\n",
      "would not pay; ‘I’ll write a satire on you,’ says he. And there was\r\n",
      "another of them on a steamer last week used the most disgraceful\r\n",
      "language to the respectable family of a civil councillor, his wife and\r\n",
      "daughter. And there was one of them turned out of a confectioner’s shop\r\n",
      "the other day. They are like that, authors, literary men, students,\r\n",
      "town-criers.... Pfoo! You get along! I shall look in upon you myself one\r\n",
      "day. Then you had better be careful! Do you hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With hurried deference, Luise Ivanovna fell to curtsying in all\r\n",
      "directions, and so curtsied herself to the door. But at the door, she\r\n",
      "stumbled backwards against a good-looking officer with a fresh, open\r\n",
      "face and splendid thick fair whiskers. This was the superintendent of\r\n",
      "the district himself, Nikodim Fomitch. Luise Ivanovna made haste\r\n",
      "to curtsy almost to the ground, and with mincing little steps, she\r\n",
      "fluttered out of the office.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Again thunder and lightning--a hurricane!” said Nikodim Fomitch to Ilya\r\n",
      "Petrovitch in a civil and friendly tone. “You are aroused again, you are\r\n",
      "fuming again! I heard it on the stairs!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what then!” Ilya Petrovitch drawled with gentlemanly nonchalance;\r\n",
      "and he walked with some papers to another table, with a jaunty swing of\r\n",
      "his shoulders at each step. “Here, if you will kindly look: an author,\r\n",
      "or a student, has been one at least, does not pay his debts, has given\r\n",
      "an I O U, won’t clear out of his room, and complaints are constantly\r\n",
      "being lodged against him, and here he has been pleased to make a protest\r\n",
      "against my smoking in his presence! He behaves like a cad himself, and\r\n",
      "just look at him, please. Here’s the gentleman, and very attractive he\r\n",
      "is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Poverty is not a vice, my friend, but we know you go off like powder,\r\n",
      "you can’t bear a slight, I daresay you took offence at something and\r\n",
      "went too far yourself,” continued Nikodim Fomitch, turning affably to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. “But you were wrong there; he is a capital fellow, I assure\r\n",
      "you, but explosive, explosive! He gets hot, fires up, boils over, and no\r\n",
      "stopping him! And then it’s all over! And at the bottom he’s a heart of\r\n",
      "gold! His nickname in the regiment was the Explosive Lieutenant....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what a regiment it was, too,” cried Ilya Petrovitch, much gratified\r\n",
      "at this agreeable banter, though still sulky.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had a sudden desire to say something exceptionally pleasant\r\n",
      "to them all. “Excuse me, Captain,” he began easily, suddenly addressing\r\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch, “will you enter into my position?... I am ready to\r\n",
      "ask pardon, if I have been ill-mannered. I am a poor student, sick\r\n",
      "and shattered (shattered was the word he used) by poverty. I am not\r\n",
      "studying, because I cannot keep myself now, but I shall get money.... I\r\n",
      "have a mother and sister in the province of X. They will send it to\r\n",
      "me, and I will pay. My landlady is a good-hearted woman, but she is so\r\n",
      "exasperated at my having lost my lessons, and not paying her for the\r\n",
      "last four months, that she does not even send up my dinner... and I\r\n",
      "don’t understand this I O U at all. She is asking me to pay her on this\r\n",
      "I O U. How am I to pay her? Judge for yourselves!...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But that is not our business, you know,” the head clerk was observing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes. I perfectly agree with you. But allow me to explain...”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov put in again, still addressing Nikodim Fomitch, but trying\r\n",
      "his best to address Ilya Petrovitch also, though the latter persistently\r\n",
      "appeared to be rummaging among his papers and to be contemptuously\r\n",
      "oblivious of him. “Allow me to explain that I have been living with her\r\n",
      "for nearly three years and at first... at first... for why should I not\r\n",
      "confess it, at the very beginning I promised to marry her daughter, it\r\n",
      "was a verbal promise, freely given... she was a girl... indeed, I liked\r\n",
      "her, though I was not in love with her... a youthful affair in fact...\r\n",
      "that is, I mean to say, that my landlady gave me credit freely in those\r\n",
      "days, and I led a life of... I was very heedless...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nobody asks you for these personal details, sir, we’ve no time to\r\n",
      "waste,” Ilya Petrovitch interposed roughly and with a note of triumph;\r\n",
      "but Raskolnikov stopped him hotly, though he suddenly found it\r\n",
      "exceedingly difficult to speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But excuse me, excuse me. It is for me to explain... how it all\r\n",
      "happened... In my turn... though I agree with you... it is unnecessary.\r\n",
      "But a year ago, the girl died of typhus. I remained lodging there as\r\n",
      "before, and when my landlady moved into her present quarters, she said\r\n",
      "to me... and in a friendly way... that she had complete trust in me,\r\n",
      "but still, would I not give her an I O U for one hundred and fifteen\r\n",
      "roubles, all the debt I owed her. She said if only I gave her that,\r\n",
      "she would trust me again, as much as I liked, and that she would never,\r\n",
      "never--those were her own words--make use of that I O U till I could pay\r\n",
      "of myself... and now, when I have lost my lessons and have nothing to\r\n",
      "eat, she takes action against me. What am I to say to that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All these affecting details are no business of ours.” Ilya Petrovitch\r\n",
      "interrupted rudely. “You must give a written undertaking but as for your\r\n",
      "love affairs and all these tragic events, we have nothing to do with\r\n",
      "that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come now... you are harsh,” muttered Nikodim Fomitch, sitting down at\r\n",
      "the table and also beginning to write. He looked a little ashamed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Write!” said the head clerk to Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Write what?” the latter asked, gruffly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will dictate to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov fancied that the head clerk treated him more casually and\r\n",
      "contemptuously after his speech, but strange to say he suddenly felt\r\n",
      "completely indifferent to anyone’s opinion, and this revulsion took\r\n",
      "place in a flash, in one instant. If he had cared to think a little,\r\n",
      "he would have been amazed indeed that he could have talked to them like\r\n",
      "that a minute before, forcing his feelings upon them. And where had\r\n",
      "those feelings come from? Now if the whole room had been filled, not\r\n",
      "with police officers, but with those nearest and dearest to him, he\r\n",
      "would not have found one human word for them, so empty was his heart. A\r\n",
      "gloomy sensation of agonising, everlasting solitude and remoteness, took\r\n",
      "conscious form in his soul. It was not the meanness of his sentimental\r\n",
      "effusions before Ilya Petrovitch, nor the meanness of the latter’s\r\n",
      "triumph over him that had caused this sudden revulsion in his heart.\r\n",
      "Oh, what had he to do now with his own baseness, with all these petty\r\n",
      "vanities, officers, German women, debts, police-offices? If he had been\r\n",
      "sentenced to be burnt at that moment, he would not have stirred, would\r\n",
      "hardly have heard the sentence to the end. Something was happening to\r\n",
      "him entirely new, sudden and unknown. It was not that he understood, but\r\n",
      "he felt clearly with all the intensity of sensation that he could\r\n",
      "never more appeal to these people in the police-office with sentimental\r\n",
      "effusions like his recent outburst, or with anything whatever; and that\r\n",
      "if they had been his own brothers and sisters and not police-officers,\r\n",
      "it would have been utterly out of the question to appeal to them in any\r\n",
      "circumstance of life. He had never experienced such a strange and awful\r\n",
      "sensation. And what was most agonising--it was more a sensation than a\r\n",
      "conception or idea, a direct sensation, the most agonising of all the\r\n",
      "sensations he had known in his life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The head clerk began dictating to him the usual form of declaration,\r\n",
      "that he could not pay, that he undertook to do so at a future date, that\r\n",
      "he would not leave the town, nor sell his property, and so on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you can’t write, you can hardly hold the pen,” observed the head\r\n",
      "clerk, looking with curiosity at Raskolnikov. “Are you ill?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I am giddy. Go on!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all. Sign it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The head clerk took the paper, and turned to attend to others.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov gave back the pen; but instead of getting up and going away,\r\n",
      "he put his elbows on the table and pressed his head in his hands. He\r\n",
      "felt as if a nail were being driven into his skull. A strange idea\r\n",
      "suddenly occurred to him, to get up at once, to go up to Nikodim\r\n",
      "Fomitch, and tell him everything that had happened yesterday, and then\r\n",
      "to go with him to his lodgings and to show him the things in the hole\r\n",
      "in the corner. The impulse was so strong that he got up from his seat\r\n",
      "to carry it out. “Hadn’t I better think a minute?” flashed through his\r\n",
      "mind. “No, better cast off the burden without thinking.” But all at once\r\n",
      "he stood still, rooted to the spot. Nikodim Fomitch was talking eagerly\r\n",
      "with Ilya Petrovitch, and the words reached him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s impossible, they’ll both be released. To begin with, the whole\r\n",
      "story contradicts itself. Why should they have called the porter, if it\r\n",
      "had been their doing? To inform against themselves? Or as a blind? No,\r\n",
      "that would be too cunning! Besides, Pestryakov, the student, was seen at\r\n",
      "the gate by both the porters and a woman as he went in. He was walking\r\n",
      "with three friends, who left him only at the gate, and he asked the\r\n",
      "porters to direct him, in the presence of the friends. Now, would he\r\n",
      "have asked his way if he had been going with such an object? As for\r\n",
      "Koch, he spent half an hour at the silversmith’s below, before he went\r\n",
      "up to the old woman and he left him at exactly a quarter to eight. Now\r\n",
      "just consider...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But excuse me, how do you explain this contradiction? They state\r\n",
      "themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes\r\n",
      "later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was\r\n",
      "unfastened.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself\r\n",
      "in; and they’d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been\r\n",
      "an ass and gone to look for the porter too. _He_ must have seized the\r\n",
      "interval to get downstairs and slip by them somehow. Koch keeps crossing\r\n",
      "himself and saying: ‘If I had been there, he would have jumped out and\r\n",
      "killed me with his axe.’ He is going to have a thanksgiving service--ha,\r\n",
      "ha!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And no one saw the murderer?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They might well not see him; the house is a regular Noah’s Ark,” said\r\n",
      "the head clerk, who was listening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s clear, quite clear,” Nikodim Fomitch repeated warmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it is anything but clear,” Ilya Petrovitch maintained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov picked up his hat and walked towards the door, but he did\r\n",
      "not reach it....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he recovered consciousness, he found himself sitting in a chair,\r\n",
      "supported by someone on the right side, while someone else was standing\r\n",
      "on the left, holding a yellowish glass filled with yellow water, and\r\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch standing before him, looking intently at him. He got up\r\n",
      "from the chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s this? Are you ill?” Nikodim Fomitch asked, rather sharply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He could hardly hold his pen when he was signing,” said the head clerk,\r\n",
      "settling back in his place, and taking up his work again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you been ill long?” cried Ilya Petrovitch from his place, where\r\n",
      "he, too, was looking through papers. He had, of course, come to look at\r\n",
      "the sick man when he fainted, but retired at once when he recovered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Since yesterday,” muttered Raskolnikov in reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you go out yesterday?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "them as much as possible. He took the purse, too. Then he went out of\r\n",

      "hour perhaps, instructions would be issued for his pursuit, and so at\r\n",

      "the night of his delirium when several times he had had the impulse to\r\n",
      "get up and go away, to make haste, and get rid of it all. But to get\r\n",
      "rid of it, turned out to be a very difficult task. He wandered along\r\n",
      "the bank of the Ekaterininsky Canal for half an hour or more and looked\r\n",
      "several times at the steps running down to the water, but he could not\r\n",
      "think of carrying out his plan; either rafts stood at the steps’ edge,\r\n",
      "and women were washing clothes on them, or boats were moored there, and\r\n",
      "people were swarming everywhere. Moreover he could be seen and noticed\r\n",
      "from the banks on all sides; it would look suspicious for a man to go\r\n",
      "down on purpose, stop, and throw something into the water. And what if\r\n",
      "the boxes were to float instead of sinking? And of course they would.\r\n",
      "Even as it was, everyone he met seemed to stare and look round, as if\r\n",
      "they had nothing to do but to watch him. “Why is it, or can it be my\r\n",
      "fancy?” he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last the thought struck him that it might be better to go to the\r\n",
      "Neva. There were not so many people there, he would be less observed,\r\n",
      "and it would be more convenient in every way, above all it was further\r\n",
      "off. He wondered how he could have been wandering for a good half-hour,\r\n",
      "worried and anxious in this dangerous past without thinking of it\r\n",
      "before. And that half-hour he had lost over an irrational plan, simply\r\n",
      "because he had thought of it in delirium! He had become extremely absent\r\n",
      "and forgetful and he was aware of it. He certainly must make haste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked towards the Neva along V---- Prospect, but on the way\r\n",
      "another idea struck him. “Why to the Neva? Would it not be better to go\r\n",
      "somewhere far off, to the Islands again, and there hide the things\r\n",
      "in some solitary place, in a wood or under a bush, and mark the spot\r\n",
      "perhaps?” And though he felt incapable of clear judgment, the idea\r\n",
      "seemed to him a sound one. But he was not destined to go there. For\r\n",
      "coming out of V---- Prospect towards the square, he saw on the left a\r\n",
      "passage leading between two blank walls to a courtyard. On the right\r\n",
      "hand, the blank unwhitewashed wall of a four-storied house stretched far\r\n",
      "into the court; on the left, a wooden hoarding ran parallel with it for\r\n",
      "twenty paces into the court, and then turned sharply to the left. Here\r\n",
      "was a deserted fenced-off place where rubbish of different sorts was\r\n",
      "lying. At the end of the court, the corner of a low, smutty, stone shed,\r\n",
      "apparently part of some workshop, peeped from behind the hoarding. It\r\n",
      "was probably a carriage builder’s or carpenter’s shed; the whole place\r\n",
      "from the entrance was black with coal dust. Here would be the place to\r\n",
      "throw it, he thought. Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and\r\n",
      "at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where\r\n",
      "there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had\r\n",
      "been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, “Standing here\r\n",
      "strictly forbidden.” This was all the better, for there would be nothing\r\n",
      "suspicious about his going in. “Here I could throw it all in a heap and\r\n",
      "get away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed\r\n",
      "against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn\r\n",
      "stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a\r\n",
      "street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he\r\n",
      "could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the\r\n",
      "street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He bent down over the stone, seized the top of it firmly in both hands,\r\n",
      "and using all his strength turned it over. Under the stone was a small\r\n",
      "hollow in the ground, and he immediately emptied his pocket into it.\r\n",
      "The purse lay at the top, and yet the hollow was not filled up. Then he\r\n",
      "seized the stone again and with one twist turned it back, so that it was\r\n",
      "in the same position again, though it stood a very little higher. But\r\n",
      "he scraped the earth about it and pressed it at the edges with his foot.\r\n",
      "Nothing could be noticed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he went out, and turned into the square. Again an intense,\r\n",
      "almost unbearable joy overwhelmed him for an instant, as it had in\r\n",
      "the police-office. “I have buried my tracks! And who, who can think of\r\n",
      "looking under that stone? It has been lying there most likely ever since\r\n",
      "the house was built, and will lie as many years more. And if it were\r\n",
      "found, who would think of me? It is all over! No clue!” And he laughed.\r\n",
      "Yes, he remembered that he began laughing a thin, nervous noiseless\r\n",
      "laugh, and went on laughing all the time he was crossing the square. But\r\n",
      "when he reached the K---- Boulevard where two days before he had come\r\n",
      "upon that girl, his laughter suddenly ceased. Other ideas crept into his\r\n",
      "mind. He felt all at once that it would be loathsome to pass that seat\r\n",
      "on which after the girl was gone, he had sat and pondered, and that it\r\n",
      "would be hateful, too, to meet that whiskered policeman to whom he had\r\n",
      "given the twenty copecks: “Damn him!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked, looking about him angrily and distractedly. All his ideas now\r\n",
      "seemed to be circling round some single point, and he felt that there\r\n",
      "really was such a point, and that now, now, he was left facing that\r\n",
      "point--and for the first time, indeed, during the last two months.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Damn it all!” he thought suddenly, in a fit of ungovernable fury.\r\n",
      "“If it has begun, then it has begun. Hang the new life! Good Lord, how\r\n",
      "stupid it is!... And what lies I told to-day! How despicably I fawned\r\n",
      "upon that wretched Ilya Petrovitch! But that is all folly! What do I\r\n",
      "care for them all, and my fawning upon them! It is not that at all! It\r\n",
      "is not that at all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly he stopped; a new utterly unexpected and exceedingly simple\r\n",
      "question perplexed and bitterly confounded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If it all has really been done deliberately and not idiotically, if\r\n",
      "I really had a certain and definite object, how is it I did not even\r\n",
      "glance into the purse and don’t know what I had there, for which I have\r\n",
      "undergone these agonies, and have deliberately undertaken this base,\r\n",
      "filthy degrading business? And here I wanted at once to throw into the\r\n",
      "water the purse together with all the things which I had not seen\r\n",
      "either... how’s that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yes, that was so, that was all so. Yet he had known it all before, and\r\n",
      "it was not a new question for him, even when it was decided in the night\r\n",
      "without hesitation and consideration, as though so it must be, as though\r\n",
      "it could not possibly be otherwise.... Yes, he had known it all, and\r\n",
      "understood it all; it surely had all been settled even yesterday at the\r\n",
      "moment when he was bending over the box and pulling the jewel-cases out\r\n",
      "of it.... Yes, so it was.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is because I am very ill,” he decided grimly at last, “I have been\r\n",
      "worrying and fretting myself, and I don’t know what I am doing....\r\n",
      "Yesterday and the day before yesterday and all this time I have been\r\n",
      "worrying myself.... I shall get well and I shall not worry.... But what\r\n",
      "if I don’t get well at all? Good God, how sick I am of it all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked on without resting. He had a terrible longing for some\r\n",
      "distraction, but he did not know what to do, what to attempt. A new\r\n",
      "overwhelming sensation was gaining more and more mastery over him\r\n",
      "every moment; this was an immeasurable, almost physical, repulsion for\r\n",
      "everything surrounding him, an obstinate, malignant feeling of hatred.\r\n",
      "All who met him were loathsome to him--he loathed their faces, their\r\n",
      "movements, their gestures. If anyone had addressed him, he felt that he\r\n",
      "might have spat at him or bitten him....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stopped suddenly, on coming out on the bank of the Little Neva, near\r\n",
      "the bridge to Vassilyevsky Ostrov. “Why, he lives here, in that house,”\r\n",
      " he thought, “why, I have not come to Razumihin of my own accord! Here\r\n",
      "it’s the same thing over again.... Very interesting to know, though;\r\n",
      "have I come on purpose or have I simply walked here by chance? Never\r\n",
      "mind, I said the day before yesterday that I would go and see him the\r\n",
      "day _after_; well, and so I will! Besides I really cannot go further\r\n",
      "now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went up to Razumihin’s room on the fifth floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The latter was at home in his garret, busily writing at the moment, and\r\n",
      "he opened the door himself. It was four months since they had seen each\r\n",
      "other. Razumihin was sitting in a ragged dressing-gown, with slippers on\r\n",
      "his bare feet, unkempt, unshaven and unwashed. His face showed surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it you?” he cried. He looked his comrade up and down; then after a\r\n",
      "brief pause, he whistled. “As hard up as all that! Why, brother, you’ve\r\n",
      "cut me out!” he added, looking at Raskolnikov’s rags. “Come sit down,\r\n",
      "you are tired, I’ll be bound.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And when he had sunk down on the American leather sofa, which was\r\n",
      "in even worse condition than his own, Razumihin saw at once that his\r\n",
      "visitor was ill.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you are seriously ill, do you know that?” He began feeling his\r\n",
      "pulse. Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never mind,” he said, “I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I\r\n",
      "wanted,... but I don’t really want lessons....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I say! You are delirious, you know!” Razumihin observed, watching\r\n",
      "him carefully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I am not.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to\r\n",
      "Razumihin’s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend\r\n",
      "face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all\r\n",
      "disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the\r\n",
      "wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at\r\n",
      "himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin’s threshold.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good-bye,” he said abruptly, and walked to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop, stop! You queer fish.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t want to,” said the other, again pulling away his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this\r\n",
      "is... almost insulting! I won’t let you go like that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could\r\n",

      "there’s a bookseller, Heruvimov--and he takes the place of a lesson.\r\n",
      "I would not exchange him for five lessons. He’s doing publishing of a\r\n",

      "have! The very titles are worth the money! You always maintained that I\r\n",
      "was a fool, but by Jove, my boy, there are greater fools than I am!\r\n",
      "Now he is setting up for being advanced, not that he has an inkling of\r\n",
      "anything, but, of course, I encourage him. Here are two signatures of\r\n",
      "the German text--in my opinion, the crudest charlatanism; it discusses\r\n",
      "the question, ‘Is woman a human being?’ And, of course, triumphantly\r\n",
      "proves that she is. Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a\r\n",
      "contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand\r\n",
      "these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous\r\n",
      "title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He\r\n",
      "pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles\r\n",
      "for the job, and I’ve had six already in advance. When we have finished\r\n",
      "this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of\r\n",
      "the dullest scandals out of the second part of _Les Confessions_ we have\r\n",
      "marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was\r\n",
      "a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don’t contradict him, hang him!\r\n",
      "Well, would you like to do the second signature of ‘_Is woman a human\r\n",
      "being?_’ If you would, take the German and pens and paper--all those\r\n",
      "are provided, and take three roubles; for as I have had six roubles in\r\n",
      "advance on the whole thing, three roubles come to you for your share.\r\n",

      "The only comfort is, that it’s bound to be a change for the better.\r\n",

      "a violent lash on the back with his whip, for having almost fallen under\r\n",
      "his horses’ hoofs. The lash so infuriated him that he dashed away to the\r\n",
      "railing (for some unknown reason he had been walking in the very middle\r\n",

      "doubtless owed to the blow, which made them feel sorry for him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He closed his hand on the twenty copecks, walked on for ten paces, and\r\n",
      "turned facing the Neva, looking towards the palace. The sky was without\r\n",
      "a cloud and the water was almost bright blue, which is so rare in the\r\n",
      "Neva. The cupola of the cathedral, which is seen at its best from the\r\n",
      "bridge about twenty paces from the chapel, glittered in the sunlight,\r\n",
      "and in the pure air every ornament on it could be clearly distinguished.\r\n",
      "The pain from the lash went off, and Raskolnikov forgot about it; one\r\n",
      "uneasy and not quite definite idea occupied him now completely. He stood\r\n",
      "still, and gazed long and intently into the distance; this spot was\r\n",
      "especially familiar to him. When he was attending the university, he had\r\n",
      "hundreds of times--generally on his way home--stood still on this spot,\r\n",
      "gazed at this truly magnificent spectacle and almost always marvelled at\r\n",
      "a vague and mysterious emotion it roused in him. It left him strangely\r\n",
      "cold; this gorgeous picture was for him blank and lifeless. He wondered\r\n",
      "every time at his sombre and enigmatic impression and, mistrusting\r\n",
      "himself, put off finding the explanation of it. He vividly recalled\r\n",
      "those old doubts and perplexities, and it seemed to him that it was\r\n",
      "no mere chance that he recalled them now. It struck him as strange and\r\n",
      "grotesque, that he should have stopped at the same spot as before,\r\n",
      "as though he actually imagined he could think the same thoughts, be\r\n",
      "interested in the same theories and pictures that had interested him...\r\n",
      "so short a time ago. He felt it almost amusing, and yet it wrung his\r\n",
      "heart. Deep down, hidden far away out of sight all that seemed to him\r\n",
      "now--all his old past, his old thoughts, his old problems and theories,\r\n",
      "his old impressions and that picture and himself and all, all.... He\r\n",
      "felt as though he were flying upwards, and everything were vanishing\r\n",
      "from his sight. Making an unconscious movement with his hand, he\r\n",
      "suddenly became aware of the piece of money in his fist. He opened his\r\n",
      "hand, stared at the coin, and with a sweep of his arm flung it into\r\n",
      "the water; then he turned and went home. It seemed to him, he had cut\r\n",
      "himself off from everyone and from everything at that moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Evening was coming on when he reached home, so that he must have been\r\n",
      "walking about six hours. How and where he came back he did not remember.\r\n",
      "Undressing, and quivering like an overdriven horse, he lay down on the\r\n",
      "sofa, drew his greatcoat over him, and at once sank into oblivion....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was dusk when he was waked up by a fearful scream. Good God, what a\r\n",
      "scream! Such unnatural sounds, such howling, wailing, grinding, tears,\r\n",
      "blows and curses he had never heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could never have imagined such brutality, such frenzy. In terror he\r\n",
      "sat up in bed, almost swooning with agony. But the fighting, wailing\r\n",
      "and cursing grew louder and louder. And then to his intense amazement\r\n",
      "he caught the voice of his landlady. She was howling, shrieking and\r\n",
      "wailing, rapidly, hurriedly, incoherently, so that he could not make\r\n",
      "out what she was talking about; she was beseeching, no doubt, not to be\r\n",
      "beaten, for she was being mercilessly beaten on the stairs. The voice of\r\n",
      "her assailant was so horrible from spite and rage that it was almost\r\n",
      "a croak; but he, too, was saying something, and just as quickly\r\n",
      "and indistinctly, hurrying and spluttering. All at once Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "trembled; he recognised the voice--it was the voice of Ilya Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "Ilya Petrovitch here and beating the landlady! He is kicking her,\r\n",
      "banging her head against the steps--that’s clear, that can be told\r\n",
      "from the sounds, from the cries and the thuds. How is it, is the world\r\n",
      "topsy-turvy? He could hear people running in crowds from all the storeys\r\n",
      "and all the staircases; he heard voices, exclamations, knocking, doors\r\n",
      "banging. “But why, why, and how could it be?” he repeated, thinking\r\n",
      "seriously that he had gone mad. But no, he heard too distinctly! And\r\n",
      "they would come to him then next, “for no doubt... it’s all about\r\n",
      "that... about yesterday.... Good God!” He would have fastened his door\r\n",
      "with the latch, but he could not lift his hand... besides, it would\r\n",
      "be useless. Terror gripped his heart like ice, tortured him and numbed\r\n",
      "him.... But at last all this uproar, after continuing about ten minutes,\r\n",
      "began gradually to subside. The landlady was moaning and groaning; Ilya\r\n",
      "Petrovitch was still uttering threats and curses.... But at last he,\r\n",
      "too, seemed to be silent, and now he could not be heard. “Can he have\r\n",
      "gone away? Good Lord!” Yes, and now the landlady is going too, still\r\n",
      "weeping and moaning... and then her door slammed.... Now the crowd was\r\n",
      "going from the stairs to their rooms, exclaiming, disputing, calling\r\n",
      "to one another, raising their voices to a shout, dropping them to a\r\n",
      "whisper. There must have been numbers of them--almost all the inmates\r\n",
      "of the block. “But, good God, how could it be! And why, why had he come\r\n",
      "here!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sank worn out on the sofa, but could not close his eyes. He\r\n",
      "lay for half an hour in such anguish, such an intolerable sensation of\r\n",
      "infinite terror as he had never experienced before. Suddenly a bright\r\n",
      "light flashed into his room. Nastasya came in with a candle and a plate\r\n",
      "of soup. Looking at him carefully and ascertaining that he was not\r\n",
      "asleep, she set the candle on the table and began to lay out what she\r\n",
      "had brought--bread, salt, a plate, a spoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ve eaten nothing since yesterday, I warrant. You’ve been trudging\r\n",
      "about all day, and you’re shaking with fever.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nastasya... what were they beating the landlady for?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She looked intently at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who beat the landlady?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just now... half an hour ago, Ilya Petrovitch, the assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent, on the stairs.... Why was he ill-treating her like that,\r\n",
      "and... why was he here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya scrutinised him, silent and frowning, and her scrutiny lasted a\r\n",
      "long time. He felt uneasy, even frightened at her searching eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nastasya, why don’t you speak?” he said timidly at last in a weak\r\n",
      "voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s the blood,” she answered at last softly, as though speaking to\r\n",
      "herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blood? What blood?” he muttered, growing white and turning towards the\r\n",
      "wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya still looked at him without speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nobody has been beating the landlady,” she declared at last in a firm,\r\n",
      "resolute voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gazed at her, hardly able to breathe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I heard it myself.... I was not asleep... I was sitting up,” he\r\n",
      "said still more timidly. “I listened a long while. The assistant\r\n",
      "superintendent came.... Everyone ran out on to the stairs from all the\r\n",
      "flats.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No one has been here. That’s the blood crying in your ears. When\r\n",
      "there’s no outlet for it and it gets clotted, you begin fancying\r\n",
      "things.... Will you eat something?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He made no answer. Nastasya still stood over him, watching him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me something to drink... Nastasya.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went downstairs and returned with a white earthenware jug of water.\r\n",
      "He remembered only swallowing one sip of the cold water and spilling\r\n",
      "some on his neck. Then followed forgetfulness.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was not completely unconscious, however, all the time he was ill; he\r\n",
      "was in a feverish state, sometimes delirious, sometimes half conscious.\r\n",
      "He remembered a great deal afterwards. Sometimes it seemed as though\r\n",
      "there were a number of people round him; they wanted to take him away\r\n",
      "somewhere, there was a great deal of squabbling and discussing about\r\n",
      "him. Then he would be alone in the room; they had all gone away afraid\r\n",
      "of him, and only now and then opened the door a crack to look at him;\r\n",
      "they threatened him, plotted something together, laughed, and mocked\r\n",
      "at him. He remembered Nastasya often at his bedside; he distinguished\r\n",
      "another person, too, whom he seemed to know very well, though he could\r\n",
      "not remember who he was, and this fretted him, even made him cry.\r\n",
      "Sometimes he fancied he had been lying there a month; at other times\r\n",
      "it all seemed part of the same day. But of _that_--of _that_ he had\r\n",
      "no recollection, and yet every minute he felt that he had forgotten\r\n",
      "something he ought to remember. He worried and tormented himself trying\r\n",
      "to remember, moaned, flew into a rage, or sank into awful, intolerable\r\n",
      "terror. Then he struggled to get up, would have run away, but someone\r\n",
      "always prevented him by force, and he sank back into impotence and\r\n",
      "forgetfulness. At last he returned to complete consciousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened at ten o’clock in the morning. On fine days the sun shone\r\n",
      "into the room at that hour, throwing a streak of light on the right\r\n",
      "wall and the corner near the door. Nastasya was standing beside him\r\n",
      "with another person, a complete stranger, who was looking at him\r\n",
      "very inquisitively. He was a young man with a beard, wearing a full,\r\n",
      "short-waisted coat, and looked like a messenger. The landlady was\r\n",
      "peeping in at the half-opened door. Raskolnikov sat up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is this, Nastasya?” he asked, pointing to the young man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say, he’s himself again!” she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is himself,” echoed the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Concluding that he had returned to his senses, the landlady closed the\r\n",
      "door and disappeared. She was always shy and dreaded conversations or\r\n",
      "discussions. She was a woman of forty, not at all bad-looking, fat\r\n",
      "and buxom, with black eyes and eyebrows, good-natured from fatness and\r\n",
      "laziness, and absurdly bashful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who... are you?” he went on, addressing the man. But at that moment\r\n",
      "the door was flung open, and, stooping a little, as he was so tall,\r\n",
      "Razumihin came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a cabin it is!” he cried. “I am always knocking my head. You call\r\n",
      "this a lodging! So you are conscious, brother? I’ve just heard the news\r\n",
      "from Pashenka.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has just come to,” said Nastasya.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just come to,” echoed the man again, with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And who are you?” Razumihin asked, suddenly addressing him. “My name is\r\n",
      "Vrazumihin, at your service; not Razumihin, as I am always called, but\r\n",
      "Vrazumihin, a student and gentleman; and he is my friend. And who are\r\n",
      "you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am the messenger from our office, from the merchant Shelopaev, and\r\n",
      "I’ve come on business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please sit down.” Razumihin seated himself on the other side of the\r\n",
      "table. “It’s a good thing you’ve come to, brother,” he went on to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. “For the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk\r\n",
      "anything. We had to give you tea in spoonfuls. I brought Zossimov to see\r\n",
      "you twice. You remember Zossimov? He examined you carefully and said at\r\n",
      "once it was nothing serious--something seemed to have gone to your head.\r\n",
      "Some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not\r\n",
      "had enough beer and radish, but it’s nothing much, it will pass and you\r\n",
      "will be all right. Zossimov is a first-rate fellow! He is making quite a\r\n",
      "name. Come, I won’t keep you,” he said, addressing the man again. “Will\r\n",
      "you explain what you want? You must know, Rodya, this is the second time\r\n",
      "they have sent from the office; but it was another man last time, and I\r\n",
      "talked to him. Who was it came before?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was the day before yesterday, I venture to say, if you please,\r\n",
      "sir. That was Alexey Semyonovitch; he is in our office, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He was more intelligent than you, don’t you think so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, sir, he is of more weight than I am.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite so; go on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At your mamma’s request, through Afanasy Ivanovitch Vahrushin, of whom\r\n",
      "I presume you have heard more than once, a remittance is sent to you\r\n",
      "from our office,” the man began, addressing Raskolnikov. “If you are in\r\n",
      "an intelligible condition, I’ve thirty-five roubles to remit to you, as\r\n",
      "Semyon Semyonovitch has received from Afanasy Ivanovitch at your mamma’s\r\n",
      "request instructions to that effect, as on previous occasions. Do you\r\n",
      "know him, sir?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I remember... Vahrushin,” Raskolnikov said dreamily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You hear, he knows Vahrushin,” cried Razumihin. “He is in ‘an\r\n",
      "intelligible condition’! And I see you are an intelligent man too. Well,\r\n",
      "it’s always pleasant to hear words of wisdom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s the gentleman, Vahrushin, Afanasy Ivanovitch. And at the request\r\n",
      "of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the\r\n",
      "same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent\r\n",
      "instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you\r\n",
      "thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That ‘hoping for better to come’ is the best thing you’ve said, though\r\n",
      "‘your mamma’ is not bad either. Come then, what do you say? Is he fully\r\n",
      "conscious, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all right. If only he can sign this little paper.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He can scrawl his name. Have you got the book?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, here’s the book.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give it to me. Here, Rodya, sit up. I’ll hold you. Take the pen and\r\n",

      "to us than treacle.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t want it,” said Raskolnikov, pushing away the pen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not want it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Don’t want the money! Come, brother, that’s nonsense, I bear witness.\r\n",
      "Don’t trouble, please, it’s only that he is on his travels again. But\r\n",
      "that’s pretty common with him at all times though.... You are a man of\r\n",
      "judgment and we will take him in hand, that is, more simply, take his\r\n",
      "hand and he will sign it. Here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I can come another time.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no. Why should we trouble you? You are a man of judgment.... Now,\r\n",
      "Rodya, don’t keep your visitor, you see he is waiting,” and he made\r\n",
      "ready to hold Raskolnikov’s hand in earnest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop, I’ll do it alone,” said the latter, taking the pen and signing\r\n",
      "his name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The messenger took out the money and went away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bravo! And now, brother, are you hungry?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there any soup?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Some of yesterday’s,” answered Nastasya, who was still standing there.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked at all this with profound astonishment and a dull,\r\n",
      "unreasoning terror. He made up his mind to keep quiet and see what\r\n",
      "would happen. “I believe I am not wandering. I believe it’s reality,” he\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a couple of minutes Nastasya returned with the soup, and announced\r\n",
      "that the tea would be ready directly. With the soup she brought two\r\n",
      "spoons, two plates, salt, pepper, mustard for the beef, and so on. The\r\n",
      "table was set as it had not been for a long time. The cloth was clean.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It would not be amiss, Nastasya, if Praskovya Pavlovna were to send us\r\n",
      "up a couple of bottles of beer. We could empty them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you are a cool hand,” muttered Nastasya, and she departed to\r\n",
      "carry out his orders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov still gazed wildly with strained attention. Meanwhile\r\n",
      "Razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his\r\n",
      "left arm round Raskolnikov’s head, although he was able to sit up, and\r\n",
      "with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that\r\n",
      "it might not burn him. But the soup was only just warm. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. But after\r\n",
      "giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, Razumihin suddenly stopped, and\r\n",
      "said that he must ask Zossimov whether he ought to have more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.\r\n",

      "without the faculty. But here is the beer!” He moved back to his chair,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I must tell you, Rodya, I dine like this here every day now,” he\r\n",

      "little landlady, who sees to that; she loves to do anything for me. I\r\n",
      "don’t ask for it, but, of course, I don’t object. And here’s Nastasya\r\n",
      "with the tea. She is a quick girl. Nastasya, my dear, won’t you have\r\n",
      "some beer?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He poured out two cups, left his dinner, and sat on the sofa again. As\r\n",
      "before, he put his left arm round the sick man’s head, raised him up\r\n",
      "and gave him tea in spoonfuls, again blowing each spoonful steadily and\r\n",
      "earnestly, as though this process was the principal and most effective\r\n",
      "means towards his friend’s recovery. Raskolnikov said nothing and made\r\n",
      "no resistance, though he felt quite strong enough to sit up on the sofa\r\n",
      "without support and could not merely have held a cup or a spoon, but\r\n",
      "even perhaps could have walked about. But from some queer, almost\r\n",
      "animal, cunning he conceived the idea of hiding his strength and lying\r\n",
      "low for a time, pretending if necessary not to be yet in full possession\r\n",
      "of his faculties, and meanwhile listening to find out what was going on.\r\n",
      "Yet he could not overcome his sense of repugnance. After sipping a dozen\r\n",
      "spoonfuls of tea, he suddenly released his head, pushed the spoon away\r\n",
      "capriciously, and sank back on the pillow. There were actually real\r\n",
      "pillows under his head now, down pillows in clean cases, he observed\r\n",
      "that, too, and took note of it.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“She’ll get it at the shop, my dear. You see, Rodya, all sorts of things\r\n",
      "have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in\r\n",
      "that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I\r\n",
      "resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day.\r\n",
      "How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had\r\n",
      "forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know\r\n",
      "it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the\r\n",
      "Five Corners, Harlamov’s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov’s\r\n",
      "house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov’s, but\r\n",
      "Buch’s. How one muddles up sound sometimes! So I lost my temper, and I\r\n",
      "went on the chance to the address bureau next day, and only fancy, in\r\n",
      "two minutes they looked you up! Your name is down there.”\r\n",

      "I was there. Well, it’s a long story. But as soon as I did land on this\r\n",
      "place, I soon got to know all your affairs--all, all, brother, I know\r\n",
      "everything; Nastasya here will tell you. I made the acquaintance of\r\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, and the house-porter and Mr.\r\n",
      "Zametov, Alexandr Grigorievitch, the head clerk in the police office,\r\n",
      "and, last, but not least, of Pashenka; Nastasya here knows....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s got round her,” Nastasya murmured, smiling slyly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "not Nikiforovna, but Petrovna,” she added suddenly, recovering from her\r\n",
      "mirth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll make a note of it. Well, brother, to make a long story short,\r\n",
      "I was going in for a regular explosion here to uproot all malignant\r\n",
      "influences in the locality, but Pashenka won the day. I had not\r\n",
      "expected, brother, to find her so... prepossessing. Eh, what do you\r\n",
      "think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov did not speak, but he still kept his eyes fixed upon him,\r\n",
      "full of alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And all that could be wished, indeed, in every respect,” Razumihin went\r\n",
      "on, not at all embarrassed by his silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, the sly dog!” Nastasya shrieked again. This conversation afforded\r\n",
      "her unspeakable delight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a pity, brother, that you did not set to work in the right way\r\n",
      "at first. You ought to have approached her differently. She is, so\r\n",
      "to speak, a most unaccountable character. But we will talk about her\r\n",
      "character later.... How could you let things come to such a pass that\r\n",
      "she gave up sending you your dinner? And that I O U? You must have been\r\n",
      "mad to sign an I O U. And that promise of marriage when her daughter,\r\n",
      "Natalya Yegorovna, was alive?... I know all about it! But I see that’s\r\n",
      "a delicate matter and I am an ass; forgive me. But, talking of\r\n",
      "foolishness, do you know Praskovya Pavlovna is not nearly so foolish as\r\n",
      "you would think at first sight?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” mumbled Raskolnikov, looking away, but feeling that it was better\r\n",
      "to keep up the conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She isn’t, is she?” cried Razumihin, delighted to get an answer out\r\n",
      "of him. “But she is not very clever either, eh? She is essentially,\r\n",
      "essentially an unaccountable character! I am sometimes quite at a loss,\r\n",
      "I assure you.... She must be forty; she says she is thirty-six, and\r\n",
      "of course she has every right to say so. But I swear I judge her\r\n",
      "intellectually, simply from the metaphysical point of view; there is a\r\n",
      "sort of symbolism sprung up between us, a sort of algebra or what not!\r\n",
      "I don’t understand it! Well, that’s all nonsense. Only, seeing that you\r\n",
      "are not a student now and have lost your lessons and your clothes, and\r\n",
      "that through the young lady’s death she has no need to treat you as\r\n",
      "a relation, she suddenly took fright; and as you hid in your den and\r\n",
      "dropped all your old relations with her, she planned to get rid of you.\r\n",
      "And she’s been cherishing that design a long time, but was sorry to lose\r\n",
      "the I O U, for you assured her yourself that your mother would pay.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was base of me to say that.... My mother herself is almost\r\n",
      "a beggar... and I told a lie to keep my lodging... and be fed,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov said loudly and distinctly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you did very sensibly. But the worst of it is that at that point\r\n",
      "Mr. Tchebarov turns up, a business man. Pashenka would never have\r\n",
      "thought of doing anything on her own account, she is too retiring; but\r\n",
      "the business man is by no means retiring, and first thing he puts the\r\n",
      "question, ‘Is there any hope of realising the I O U?’ Answer: there is,\r\n",
      "because he has a mother who would save her Rodya with her hundred and\r\n",
      "twenty-five roubles pension, if she has to starve herself; and a sister,\r\n",
      "too, who would go into bondage for his sake. That’s what he was building\r\n",
      "upon.... Why do you start? I know all the ins and outs of your affairs\r\n",
      "now, my dear boy--it’s not for nothing that you were so open with\r\n",
      "Pashenka when you were her prospective son-in-law, and I say all this as\r\n",
      "a friend.... But I tell you what it is; an honest and sensitive man is\r\n",
      "open; and a business man ‘listens and goes on eating’ you up. Well,\r\n",
      "then she gave the I O U by way of payment to this Tchebarov, and without\r\n",
      "hesitation he made a formal demand for payment. When I heard of all this\r\n",
      "I wanted to blow him up, too, to clear my conscience, but by that time\r\n",
      "harmony reigned between me and Pashenka, and I insisted on stopping\r\n",
      "the whole affair, engaging that you would pay. I went security for you,\r\n",
      "brother. Do you understand? We called Tchebarov, flung him ten\r\n",
      "roubles and got the I O U back from him, and here I have the honour of\r\n",
      "presenting it to you. She trusts your word now. Here, take it, you see I\r\n",
      "have torn it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin put the note on the table. Raskolnikov looked at him and\r\n",
      "turned to the wall without uttering a word. Even Razumihin felt a\r\n",
      "twinge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I see, brother,” he said a moment later, “that I have been playing the\r\n",
      "fool again. I thought I should amuse you with my chatter, and I believe\r\n",
      "I have only made you cross.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was it you I did not recognise when I was delirious?” Raskolnikov\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, and you flew into a rage about it, especially when I brought\r\n",
      "Zametov one day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Zametov? The head clerk? What for?” Raskolnikov turned round quickly\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to\r\n",
      "make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How\r\n",
      "could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital\r\n",
      "fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are\r\n",
      "friends--see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part,\r\n",
      "you know. I have only just moved. I’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna\r\n",
      "once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did I say anything in delirium?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think so! You were beside yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did I rave about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What next? What did you rave about? What people do rave about.... Well,\r\n",
      "brother, now I must not lose time. To work.” He got up from the table\r\n",
      "and took up his cap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What did I rave about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How he keeps on! Are you afraid of having let out some secret? Don’t\r\n",
      "worry yourself; you said nothing about a countess. But you said a lot\r\n",
      "about a bulldog, and about ear-rings and chains, and about Krestovsky\r\n",
      "Island, and some porter, and Nikodim Fomitch and Ilya Petrovitch, the\r\n",
      "assistant superintendent. And another thing that was of special interest\r\n",
      "to you was your own sock. You whined, ‘Give me my sock.’ Zametov\r\n",
      "hunted all about your room for your socks, and with his own scented,\r\n",
      "ring-bedecked fingers he gave you the rag. And only then were you\r\n",
      "comforted, and for the next twenty-four hours you held the wretched\r\n",
      "thing in your hand; we could not get it from you. It is most likely\r\n",
      "somewhere under your quilt at this moment. And then you asked so\r\n",
      "piteously for fringe for your trousers. We tried to find out what sort\r\n",
      "of fringe, but we could not make it out. Now to business! Here are\r\n",
      "thirty-five roubles; I take ten of them, and shall give you an account\r\n",
      "of them in an hour or two. I will let Zossimov know at the same time,\r\n",
      "though he ought to have been here long ago, for it is nearly twelve. And\r\n",
      "you, Nastasya, look in pretty often while I am away, to see whether he\r\n",
      "wants a drink or anything else. And I will tell Pashenka what is wanted\r\n",
      "myself. Good-bye!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He calls her Pashenka! Ah, he’s a deep one!” said Nastasya as he went\r\n",
      "out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist\r\n",
      "running downstairs after him. She was very eager to hear what he would\r\n",
      "say to the landlady. She was evidently quite fascinated by Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No sooner had she left the room than the sick man flung off the\r\n",
      "bedclothes and leapt out of bed like a madman. With burning, twitching\r\n",
      "impatience he had waited for them to be gone so that he might set to\r\n",
      "work. But to what work? Now, as though to spite him, it eluded him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God, only tell me one thing: do they know of it yet or not? What\r\n",
      "if they know it and are only pretending, mocking me while I am laid up,\r\n",
      "and then they will come in and tell me that it’s been discovered long\r\n",
      "ago and that they have only... What am I to do now? That’s what I’ve\r\n",
      "forgotten, as though on purpose; forgotten it all at once, I remembered\r\n",
      "a minute ago.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood in the middle of the room and gazed in miserable bewilderment\r\n",
      "about him; he walked to the door, opened it, listened; but that was not\r\n",
      "what he wanted. Suddenly, as though recalling something, he rushed to\r\n",
      "the corner where there was a hole under the paper, began examining it,\r\n",
      "put his hand into the hole, fumbled--but that was not it. He went to the\r\n",
      "stove, opened it and began rummaging in the ashes; the frayed edges of\r\n",
      "his trousers and the rags cut off his pocket were lying there just as\r\n",
      "he had thrown them. No one had looked, then! Then he remembered the sock\r\n",
      "about which Razumihin had just been telling him. Yes, there it lay on\r\n",
      "the sofa under the quilt, but it was so covered with dust and grime that\r\n",
      "Zametov could not have seen anything on it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bah, Zametov! The police office! And why am I sent for to the police\r\n",
      "office? Where’s the notice? Bah! I am mixing it up; that was then. I\r\n",
      "looked at my sock then, too, but now... now I have been ill. But\r\n",
      "what did Zametov come for? Why did Razumihin bring him?” he muttered,\r\n",
      "helplessly sitting on the sofa again. “What does it mean? Am I still in\r\n",
      "delirium, or is it real? I believe it is real.... Ah, I remember; I must\r\n",
      "escape! Make haste to escape. Yes, I must, I must escape! Yes... but\r\n",
      "where? And where are my clothes? I’ve no boots. They’ve taken them away!\r\n",
      "They’ve hidden them! I understand! Ah, here is my coat--they passed that\r\n",
      "over! And here is money on the table, thank God! And here’s the I O U...\r\n",
      "I’ll take the money and go and take another lodging. They won’t find\r\n",
      "me!... Yes, but the address bureau? They’ll find me, Razumihin will find\r\n",
      "me. Better escape altogether... far away... to America, and let them\r\n",
      "do their worst! And take the I O U... it would be of use there.... What\r\n",
      "else shall I take? They think I am ill! They don’t know that I can walk,\r\n",
      "ha-ha-ha! I could see by their eyes that they know all about it! If\r\n",
      "only I could get downstairs! And what if they have set a watch\r\n",
      "there--policemen! What’s this tea? Ah, and here is beer left, half a\r\n",
      "bottle, cold!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He snatched up the bottle, which still contained a glassful of beer, and\r\n",
      "gulped it down with relish, as though quenching a flame in his breast.\r\n",
      "But in another minute the beer had gone to his head, and a faint and\r\n",
      "even pleasant shiver ran down his spine. He lay down and pulled the\r\n",
      "quilt over him. His sick and incoherent thoughts grew more and more\r\n",
      "disconnected, and soon a light, pleasant drowsiness came upon him. With\r\n",
      "a sense of comfort he nestled his head into the pillow, wrapped more\r\n",
      "closely about him the soft, wadded quilt which had replaced the old,\r\n",
      "ragged greatcoat, sighed softly and sank into a deep, sound, refreshing\r\n",
      "sleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He woke up, hearing someone come in. He opened his eyes and saw\r\n",
      "Razumihin standing in the doorway, uncertain whether to come in or\r\n",
      "not. Raskolnikov sat up quickly on the sofa and gazed at him, as though\r\n",
      "trying to recall something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, you are not asleep! Here I am! Nastasya, bring in the parcel!”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you had a fine sleep, brother, it’s almost evening, it will be six\r\n",
      "o’clock directly. You have slept more than six hours.”\r\n",

      "“Good heavens! Have I?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And why not? It will do you good. What’s the hurry? A tryst, is it?\r\n",
      "We’ve all time before us. I’ve been waiting for the last three hours for\r\n",
      "you; I’ve been up twice and found you asleep. I’ve called on Zossimov\r\n",
      "twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And\r\n",
      "I’ve been out on my own business, too. You know I’ve been moving to-day,\r\n",
      "moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now. But that’s\r\n",
      "no matter, to business. Give me the parcel, Nastasya. We will open it\r\n",
      "directly. And how do you feel now, brother?”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov pondered. The morning seemed like a dream to him. He could\r\n",
      "not remember alone, and looked inquiringly at Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm!” said the latter, “he has forgotten. I fancied then that you were\r\n",
      "not quite yourself. Now you are better for your sleep.... You really\r\n",
      "look much better. First-rate! Well, to business. Look here, my dear\r\n",
      "boy.”\r\n",

      "ordinary cap. “Let me try it on.”\r\n",

      "proper head-covering is the first thing in dress and a recommendation in\r\n",

      "people wear their hats or caps. People think he does it from slavish\r\n",
      "politeness, but it’s simply because he is ashamed of his bird’s nest;\r\n",

      "worn. And it’s bought on condition that when’s it’s worn out, they will\r\n",

      "the United States of America, as they called them at school. I assure\r\n",

      "to match, quite in the fashion. And its being worn really is an\r\n",

      "the great thing for getting on in the world is always to keep to the\r\n",
      "seasons; if you don’t insist on having asparagus in January, you keep\r\n",
      "your money in your purse; and it’s the same with this purchase. It’s\r\n",

      "do you say? Two roubles twenty-five copecks! And remember the condition:\r\n",
      "if you wear these out, you will have another suit for nothing! They only\r\n",
      "do business on that system at Fedyaev’s; if you’ve bought a thing once,\r\n",

      "a bit worn, but they’ll last a couple of months, for it’s foreign work\r\n",
      "and foreign leather; the secretary of the English Embassy sold them last\r\n",
      "week--he had only worn them six days, but he was very short of cash.\r\n",

      "Forty-five copecks change in coppers. Will you take it? And so, Rodya,\r\n",
      "you are set up with a complete new rig-out, for your overcoat will\r\n",
      "serve, and even has a style of its own. That comes from getting one’s\r\n",
      "clothes from Sharmer’s! As for your socks and other things, I leave them\r\n",
      "to you; we’ve twenty-five roubles left. And as for Pashenka and paying\r\n",
      "for your lodging, don’t you worry. I tell you she’ll trust you for\r\n",

      "Zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face\r\n",
      "and straight flaxen hair. He wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on\r\n",
      "his fat finger. He was twenty-seven. He had on a light grey fashionable\r\n",
      "loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose,\r\n",
      "fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his\r\n",
      "watch-chain was massive. In manner he was slow and, as it were,\r\n",
      "nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made\r\n",
      "efforts to conceal his self-importance, but it was apparent at every\r\n",
      "instant. All his acquaintances found him tedious, but said he was clever\r\n",
      "at his work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“I see, I see; and how do we feel now, eh?” said Zossimov to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the\r\n",
      "sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is still depressed,” Razumihin went on. “We’ve just changed his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That’s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I am well, I am perfectly well!” Raskolnikov declared positively\r\n",
      "and irritably. He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with\r\n",
      "glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to\r\n",
      "the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "course, you must not give him; he’d better not have meat either, and...\r\n",
      "but no need to tell you that!” Razumihin and he looked at each\r\n",

      "examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the\r\n",
      "petals and how many lines on them. He felt his arms and legs as lifeless\r\n",

      "“Why, he was accused of the murder,” Razumihin went on hotly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was there evidence against him then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Evidence, indeed! Evidence that was no evidence, and that’s what we\r\n",
      "have to prove. It was just as they pitched on those fellows, Koch and\r\n",
      "Pestryakov, at first. Foo! how stupidly it’s all done, it makes one\r\n",
      "sick, though it’s not one’s business! Pestryakov may be coming\r\n",
      "to-night.... By the way, Rodya, you’ve heard about the business already;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Maybe I am, but we will get him off anyway,” shouted Razumihin,\r\n",

      "for it leads to truth--what is offensive is that they lie and worship\r\n",
      "their own lying.... I respect Porfiry, but... What threw them out at\r\n",
      "first? The door was locked, and when they came back with the porter\r\n",
      "it was open. So it followed that Koch and Pestryakov were the\r\n",
      "murderers--that was their logic!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But don’t excite yourself; they simply detained them, they could not\r\n",
      "help that.... And, by the way, I’ve met that man Koch. He used to buy\r\n",
      "unredeemed pledges from the old woman? Eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, he is a swindler. He buys up bad debts, too. He makes a profession\r\n",
      "of it. But enough of him! Do you know what makes me angry? It’s their\r\n",
      "sickening rotten, petrified routine.... And this case might be the means\r\n",
      "of introducing a new method. One can show from the psychological data\r\n",
      "alone how to get on the track of the real man. ‘We have facts,’ they\r\n",
      "say. But facts are not everything--at least half the business lies in\r\n",

      "“I am waiting to hear about the painter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes! Well, here’s the story. Early on the third day after the\r\n",
      "murder, when they were still dandling Koch and Pestryakov--though they\r\n",
      "accounted for every step they took and it was as plain as a pikestaff--an\r\n",
      "unexpected fact turned up. A peasant called Dushkin, who keeps a\r\n",
      "dram-shop facing the house, brought to the police office a jeweller’s\r\n",
      "case containing some gold ear-rings, and told a long rigamarole. ‘The\r\n",
      "day before yesterday, just after eight o’clock’--mark the day and the\r\n",
      "hour!--‘a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me\r\n",
      "already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and\r\n",
      "asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got\r\n",
      "them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him\r\n",
      "anything more.’ I am telling you Dushkin’s story. ‘I gave him a note’--a\r\n",
      "rouble that is--‘for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would\r\n",
      "with another. It would all come to the same thing--he’d spend it on\r\n",
      "drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it\r\n",
      "the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any\r\n",
      "rumours, I’ll take it to the police.’ Of course, that’s all taradiddle;\r\n",
      "he lies like a horse, for I know this Dushkin, he is a pawnbroker and\r\n",
      "a receiver of stolen goods, and he did not cheat Nikolay out of a\r\n",
      "thirty-rouble trinket in order to give it to the police. He was simply\r\n",
      "afraid. But no matter, to return to Dushkin’s story. ‘I’ve known\r\n",
      "this peasant, Nikolay Dementyev, from a child; he comes from the same\r\n",
      "province and district of Zaraïsk, we are both Ryazan men. And though\r\n",
      "Nikolay is not a drunkard, he drinks, and I knew he had a job in that\r\n",
      "house, painting work with Dmitri, who comes from the same village, too.\r\n",
      "As soon as he got the rouble he changed it, had a couple of glasses,\r\n",
      "took his change and went out. But I did not see Dmitri with him then.\r\n",
      "And the next day I heard that someone had murdered Alyona Ivanovna and\r\n",
      "her sister, Lizaveta Ivanovna, with an axe. I knew them, and I felt\r\n",
      "suspicious about the ear-rings at once, for I knew the murdered woman\r\n",
      "lent money on pledges. I went to the house, and began to make careful\r\n",
      "inquiries without saying a word to anyone. First of all I asked, “Is\r\n",
      "Nikolay here?” Dmitri told me that Nikolay had gone off on the spree; he\r\n",
      "had come home at daybreak drunk, stayed in the house about ten minutes,\r\n",
      "and went out again. Dmitri didn’t see him again and is finishing the\r\n",
      "job alone. And their job is on the same staircase as the murder, on\r\n",
      "the second floor. When I heard all that I did not say a word to\r\n",
      "anyone’--that’s Dushkin’s tale--‘but I found out what I could about\r\n",
      "the murder, and went home feeling as suspicious as ever. And at eight\r\n",
      "o’clock this morning’--that was the third day, you understand--‘I saw\r\n",
      "Nikolay coming in, not sober, though not to say very drunk--he could\r\n",
      "understand what was said to him. He sat down on the bench and did not\r\n",
      "speak. There was only one stranger in the bar and a man I knew asleep\r\n",
      "on a bench and our two boys. “Have you seen Dmitri?” said I. “No, I\r\n",
      "haven’t,” said he. “And you’ve not been here either?” “Not since the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday,” said he. “And where did you sleep last night?”\r\n",
      " “In Peski, with the Kolomensky men.” “And where did you get those\r\n",
      "ear-rings?” I asked. “I found them in the street,” and the way he said\r\n",
      "it was a bit queer; he did not look at me. “Did you hear what happened\r\n",
      "that very evening, at that very hour, on that same staircase?” said I.\r\n",
      "“No,” said he, “I had not heard,” and all the while he was listening,\r\n",
      "his eyes were staring out of his head and he turned as white as chalk. I\r\n",
      "told him all about it and he took his hat and began getting up. I wanted\r\n",
      "to keep him. “Wait a bit, Nikolay,” said I, “won’t you have a drink?”\r\n",
      " And I signed to the boy to hold the door, and I came out from behind the\r\n",
      "bar; but he darted out and down the street to the turning at a run.\r\n",
      "I have not seen him since. Then my doubts were at an end--it was his\r\n",
      "doing, as clear as could be....’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "they detained Dushkin and searched his house; Dmitri, too, was arrested;\r\n",
      "the Kolomensky men also were turned inside out. And the day before\r\n",
      "yesterday they arrested Nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. He\r\n",
      "had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram\r\n",
      "for it. They gave it to him. A few minutes afterwards the woman went\r\n",
      "to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable\r\n",
      "adjoining he had made a noose of his sash from the beam, stood on a\r\n",
      "block of wood, and was trying to put his neck in the noose. The woman\r\n",
      "screeched her hardest; people ran in. ‘So that’s what you are up to!’\r\n",
      "‘Take me,’ he says, ‘to such-and-such a police officer; I’ll confess\r\n",
      "everything.’ Well, they took him to that police station--that is\r\n",
      "here--with a suitable escort. So they asked him this and that, how old\r\n",
      "he is, ‘twenty-two,’ and so on. At the question, ‘When you were working\r\n",
      "with Dmitri, didn’t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a\r\n",
      "time?’--answer: ‘To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did\r\n",
      "not notice them.’ ‘And didn’t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?’\r\n",
      "‘We heard nothing special.’ ‘And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same\r\n",
      "day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?’ ‘I\r\n",
      "never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy\r\n",
      "Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.’ ‘And where did you find the\r\n",
      "ear-rings?’ ‘I found them on the pavement.’ ‘Why didn’t you go to work\r\n",
      "with Dmitri the other day?’ ‘Because I was drinking.’ ‘And where were\r\n",
      "you drinking?’ ‘Oh, in such-and-such a place.’ ‘Why did you run away\r\n",
      "from Dushkin’s?’ ‘Because I was awfully frightened.’ ‘What were\r\n",
      "you frightened of?’ ‘That I should be accused.’ ‘How could you be\r\n",
      "frightened, if you felt free from guilt?’ Now, Zossimov, you may not\r\n",
      "believe me, that question was put literally in those words. I know it\r\n",
      "for a fact, it was repeated to me exactly! What do you say to that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, anyway, there’s the evidence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not talking of the evidence now, I am talking about that question,\r\n",
      "of their own idea of themselves. Well, so they squeezed and squeezed\r\n",
      "him and he confessed: ‘I did not find it in the street, but in the flat\r\n",
      "where I was painting with Dmitri.’ ‘And how was that?’ ‘Why, Dmitri and\r\n",
      "I were painting there all day, and we were just getting ready to go, and\r\n",
      "Dmitri took a brush and painted my face, and he ran off and I after him.\r\n",
      "I ran after him, shouting my hardest, and at the bottom of the stairs I\r\n",
      "ran right against the porter and some gentlemen--and how many gentlemen\r\n",
      "were there I don’t remember. And the porter swore at me, and the other\r\n",
      "porter swore, too, and the porter’s wife came out, and swore at us, too;\r\n",
      "and a gentleman came into the entry with a lady, and he swore at us,\r\n",
      "too, for Dmitri and I lay right across the way. I got hold of Dmitri’s\r\n",
      "hair and knocked him down and began beating him. And Dmitri, too, caught\r\n",
      "me by the hair and began beating me. But we did it all not for temper\r\n",
      "but in a friendly way, for sport. And then Dmitri escaped and ran into\r\n",
      "the street, and I ran after him; but I did not catch him, and went back\r\n",
      "to the flat alone; I had to clear up my things. I began putting them\r\n",
      "together, expecting Dmitri to come, and there in the passage, in the\r\n",
      "corner by the door, I stepped on the box. I saw it lying there wrapped\r\n",
      "up in paper. I took off the paper, saw some little hooks, undid them,\r\n",
      "and in the box were the ear-rings....’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Behind the door? Lying behind the door? Behind the door?” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "cried suddenly, staring with a blank look of terror at Razumihin, and he\r\n",
      "slowly sat up on the sofa, leaning on his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... why? What’s the matter? What’s wrong?” Razumihin, too, got up\r\n",
      "from his seat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing,” Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were\r\n",
      "silent for a while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He must have waked from a dream,” Razumihin said at last, looking\r\n",
      "inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, go on,” said Zossimov. “What next?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and\r\n",
      "everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got\r\n",
      "a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and\r\n",
      "went off drinking. He keeps repeating his old story about the murder:\r\n",
      "‘I know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.’\r\n",
      "‘And why didn’t you come to the police till now?’ ‘I was frightened.’\r\n",
      "‘And why did you try to hang yourself?’ ‘From anxiety.’ ‘What anxiety?’\r\n",
      "‘That I should be accused of it.’ Well, that’s the whole story. And now\r\n",
      "what do you suppose they deduced from that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, there’s no supposing. There’s a clue, such as it is, a fact. You\r\n",
      "wouldn’t have your painter set free?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Now they’ve simply taken him for the murderer. They haven’t a shadow of\r\n",
      "doubt.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s nonsense. You are excited. But what about the ear-rings? You\r\n",
      "must admit that, if on the very same day and hour ear-rings from the old\r\n",
      "woman’s box have come into Nikolay’s hands, they must have come there\r\n",
      "somehow. That’s a good deal in such a case.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How did they get there? How did they get there?” cried Razumihin.\r\n",
      "“How can you, a doctor, whose duty it is to study man and who has more\r\n",
      "opportunity than anyone else for studying human nature--how can you fail\r\n",
      "to see the character of the man in the whole story? Don’t you see at\r\n",
      "once that the answers he has given in the examination are the holy\r\n",
      "truth? They came into his hand precisely as he has told us--he stepped\r\n",
      "on the box and picked it up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The holy truth! But didn’t he own himself that he told a lie at first?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen to me, listen attentively. The porter and Koch and Pestryakov\r\n",
      "and the other porter and the wife of the first porter and the woman who\r\n",
      "was sitting in the porter’s lodge and the man Kryukov, who had just got\r\n",
      "out of a cab at that minute and went in at the entry with a lady on his\r\n",

      "the ground, was lying on him beating him, while Dmitri hung on to his\r\n",
      "hair, beating him, too. They lay right across the way, blocking the\r\n",
      "thoroughfare. They were sworn at on all sides while they ‘like children’\r\n",
      "(the very words of the witnesses) were falling over one another,\r\n",
      "squealing, fighting and laughing with the funniest faces, and, chasing\r\n",
      "one another like children, they ran into the street. Now take careful\r\n",
      "note. The bodies upstairs were warm, you understand, warm when they\r\n",
      "found them! If they, or Nikolay alone, had murdered them and broken open\r\n",
      "the boxes, or simply taken part in the robbery, allow me to ask you one\r\n",
      "question: do their state of mind, their squeals and giggles and childish\r\n",
      "scuffling at the gate fit in with axes, bloodshed, fiendish cunning,\r\n",
      "robbery? They’d just killed them, not five or ten minutes before, for\r\n",
      "the bodies were still warm, and at once, leaving the flat open, knowing\r\n",
      "that people would go there at once, flinging away their booty, they\r\n",
      "rolled about like children, laughing and attracting general attention.\r\n",
      "And there are a dozen witnesses to swear to that!”\r\n",

      "“Of course it is strange! It’s impossible, indeed, but...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, brother, no _buts_. And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay’s\r\n",
      "hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important\r\n",
      "piece of circumstantial evidence against him--although the explanation\r\n",
      "given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously\r\n",
      "against him--one must take into consideration the facts which prove him\r\n",
      "innocent, especially as they are facts that _cannot be denied_. And\r\n",
      "do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will\r\n",
      "accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact--resting\r\n",
      "simply on a psychological impossibility--as irrefutable and conclusively\r\n",
      "breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution? No, they\r\n",
      "won’t accept it, they certainly won’t, because they found the jewel-case\r\n",
      "and the man tried to hang himself, ‘which he could not have done if he\r\n",
      "hadn’t felt guilty.’ That’s the point, that’s what excites me, you must\r\n",
      "understand!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I see you are excited! Wait a bit. I forgot to ask you; what proof\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That’s been proved,” said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning.\r\n",

      "proved conclusively that it was his.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time\r\n",
      "that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no\r\n",
      "evidence about that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nobody did see him,” Razumihin answered with vexation. “That’s the\r\n",
      "worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way\r\n",
      "upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.\r\n",
      "They said they saw the flat was open, and that there must be work going\r\n",
      "on in it, but they took no special notice and could not remember whether\r\n",
      "there actually were men at work in it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm!... So the only evidence for the defence is that they were beating\r\n",

      "How do you explain the facts yourself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do I explain them? What is there to explain? It’s clear. At any\r\n",
      "rate, the direction in which explanation is to be sought is clear, and\r\n",
      "the jewel-case points to it. The real murderer dropped those ear-rings.\r\n",
      "The murderer was upstairs, locked in, when Koch and Pestryakov knocked\r\n",
      "at the door. Koch, like an ass, did not stay at the door; so the\r\n",
      "murderer popped out and ran down, too; for he had no other way of\r\n",
      "escape. He hid from Koch, Pestryakov and the porter in the flat when\r\n",
      "Nikolay and Dmitri had just run out of it. He stopped there while the\r\n",
      "porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of\r\n",
      "hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri\r\n",
      "and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry;\r\n",
      "possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going\r\n",
      "in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when\r\n",
      "he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he\r\n",
      "had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that\r\n",
      "he did stand there.... That’s how I explain it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Too clever! No, my boy, you’re too clever. That beats everything.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But, why, why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, because everything fits too well... it’s too melodramatic.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ach!” Razumihin was exclaiming, but at that moment the door opened\r\n",
      "and a personage came in who was a stranger to all present.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CHAPTER V\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was a gentleman no longer young, of a stiff and portly appearance,\r\n",
      "and a cautious and sour countenance. He began by stopping short in the\r\n",
      "doorway, staring about him with offensive and undisguised astonishment,\r\n",
      "as though asking himself what sort of place he had come to.\r\n",
      "Mistrustfully and with an affectation of being alarmed and almost\r\n",
      "affronted, he scanned Raskolnikov’s low and narrow “cabin.” With the\r\n",
      "same amazement he stared at Raskolnikov, who lay undressed, dishevelled,\r\n",
      "unwashed, on his miserable dirty sofa, looking fixedly at him. Then with\r\n",
      "the same deliberation he scrutinised the uncouth, unkempt figure and\r\n",
      "unshaven face of Razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the\r\n",
      "face without rising from his seat. A constrained silence lasted for a\r\n",
      "couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting\r\n",
      "took place. Reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs,\r\n",
      "that he would get nothing in this “cabin” by attempting to overawe them,\r\n",
      "the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity,\r\n",
      "emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed Zossimov:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not\r\n",
      "Razumihin anticipated him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here he is lying on the sofa! What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This familiar “what do you want” seemed to cut the ground from the\r\n",
      "feet of the pompous gentleman. He was turning to Razumihin, but checked\r\n",
      "himself in time and turned to Zossimov again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is Raskolnikov,” mumbled Zossimov, nodding towards him. Then he\r\n",
      "gave a prolonged yawn, opening his mouth as wide as possible. Then he\r\n",
      "lazily put his hand into his waistcoat-pocket, pulled out a huge gold\r\n",
      "watch in a round hunter’s case, opened it, looked at it and as slowly\r\n",
      "and lazily proceeded to put it back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing\r\n",
      "persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. Now that\r\n",
      "his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it\r\n",
      "was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just\r\n",
      "undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. But\r\n",
      "the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder,\r\n",
      "then suspicion and even alarm. When Zossimov said “This is Raskolnikov”\r\n",
      " he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but\r\n",
      "weak and breaking, voice articulated:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I am Raskolnikov! What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin. I believe I have reason to hope that my name\r\n",
      "is not wholly unknown to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed\r\n",
      "blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the\r\n",
      "name of Pyotr Petrovitch for the first time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it possible that you can up to the present have received no\r\n",
      "information?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In reply Raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands\r\n",
      "behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. A look of dismay came into\r\n",
      "Luzhin’s face. Zossimov and Razumihin stared at him more inquisitively\r\n",
      "than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I had presumed and calculated,” he faltered, “that a letter posted more\r\n",
      "than ten days, if not a fortnight ago...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say, why are you standing in the doorway?” Razumihin interrupted\r\n",
      "suddenly. “If you’ve something to say, sit down. Nastasya and you are so\r\n",
      "crowded. Nastasya, make room. Here’s a chair, thread your way in!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved his chair back from the table, made a little space between the\r\n",
      "table and his knees, and waited in a rather cramped position for the\r\n",
      "visitor to “thread his way in.” The minute was so chosen that it was\r\n",
      "impossible to refuse, and the visitor squeezed his way through, hurrying\r\n",
      "and stumbling. Reaching the chair, he sat down, looking suspiciously at\r\n",
      "Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No need to be nervous,” the latter blurted out. “Rodya has been ill for\r\n",
      "the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and\r\n",
      "has got an appetite. This is his doctor, who has just had a look at him.\r\n",
      "I am a comrade of Rodya’s, like him, formerly a student, and now I am\r\n",
      "nursing him; so don’t you take any notice of us, but go on with your\r\n",
      "business.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank you. But shall I not disturb the invalid by my presence and\r\n",
      "conversation?” Pyotr Petrovitch asked of Zossimov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no,” mumbled Zossimov; “you may amuse him.” He yawned again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has been conscious a long time, since the morning,” went on\r\n",
      "Razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature\r\n",
      "that Pyotr Petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps,\r\n",
      "because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a\r\n",
      "student.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your mamma,” began Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hm!” Razumihin cleared his throat loudly. Luzhin looked at him\r\n",
      "inquiringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all right, go on.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Luzhin shrugged his shoulders.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your mamma had commenced a letter to you while I was sojourning in\r\n",
      "her neighbourhood. On my arrival here I purposely allowed a few days to\r\n",
      "elapse before coming to see you, in order that I might be fully\r\n",
      "assured that you were in full possession of the tidings; but now, to my\r\n",
      "astonishment...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know, I know!” Raskolnikov cried suddenly with impatient vexation.\r\n",
      "“So you are the _fiancé_? I know, and that’s enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no doubt about Pyotr Petrovitch’s being offended this time,\r\n",
      "but he said nothing. He made a violent effort to understand what it all\r\n",
      "meant. There was a moment’s silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Raskolnikov, who had turned a little towards him when he\r\n",
      "answered, began suddenly staring at him again with marked curiosity, as\r\n",
      "though he had not had a good look at him yet, or as though something\r\n",
      "new had struck him; he rose from his pillow on purpose to stare at\r\n",
      "him. There certainly was something peculiar in Pyotr Petrovitch’s whole\r\n",
      "appearance, something which seemed to justify the title of “fiancé” so\r\n",
      "unceremoniously applied to him. In the first place, it was evident, far\r\n",
      "too much so indeed, that Pyotr Petrovitch had made eager use of his few\r\n",
      "days in the capital to get himself up and rig himself out in expectation\r\n",
      "of his betrothed--a perfectly innocent and permissible proceeding,\r\n",
      "indeed. Even his own, perhaps too complacent, consciousness of the\r\n",
      "agreeable improvement in his appearance might have been forgiven in such\r\n",
      "circumstances, seeing that Pyotr Petrovitch had taken up the rôle of\r\n",
      "fiancé. All his clothes were fresh from the tailor’s and were all\r\n",
      "right, except for being too new and too distinctly appropriate. Even\r\n",
      "the stylish new round hat had the same significance. Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "treated it too respectfully and held it too carefully in his hands. The\r\n",
      "exquisite pair of lavender gloves, real Louvain, told the same tale,\r\n",

      "his hand for show. Light and youthful colours predominated in Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch’s attire. He wore a charming summer jacket of a fawn shade,\r\n",
      "light thin trousers, a waistcoat of the same, new and fine linen, a\r\n",
      "cravat of the lightest cambric with pink stripes on it, and the best\r\n",
      "of it was, this all suited Pyotr Petrovitch. His very fresh and even\r\n",
      "handsome face looked younger than his forty-five years at all times.\r\n",
      "His dark, mutton-chop whiskers made an agreeable setting on both sides,\r\n",
      "growing thickly upon his shining, clean-shaven chin. Even his hair,\r\n",
      "touched here and there with grey, though it had been combed and curled\r\n",
      "at a hairdresser’s, did not give him a stupid appearance, as curled hair\r\n",
      "usually does, by inevitably suggesting a German on his wedding-day.\r\n",
      "If there really was something unpleasing and repulsive in his rather\r\n",
      "good-looking and imposing countenance, it was due to quite other\r\n",
      "causes. After scanning Mr. Luzhin unceremoniously, Raskolnikov smiled\r\n",
      "malignantly, sank back on the pillow and stared at the ceiling as\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mr. Luzhin hardened his heart and seemed to determine to take no\r\n",
      "notice of their oddities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I feel the greatest regret at finding you in this situation,” he began,\r\n",
      "again breaking the silence with an effort. “If I had been aware of your\r\n",
      "illness I should have come earlier. But you know what business is. I\r\n",
      "have, too, a very important legal affair in the Senate, not to mention\r\n",
      "other preoccupations which you may well conjecture. I am expecting your\r\n",
      "mamma and sister any minute.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov made a movement and seemed about to speak; his face showed\r\n",
      "some excitement. Pyotr Petrovitch paused, waited, but as nothing\r\n",
      "followed, he went on:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“... Any minute. I have found a lodging for them on their arrival.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where?” asked Raskolnikov weakly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very near here, in Bakaleyev’s house.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s in Voskresensky,” put in Razumihin. “There are two storeys of\r\n",
      "rooms, let by a merchant called Yushin; I’ve been there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, rooms...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A disgusting place--filthy, stinking and, what’s more, of doubtful\r\n",
      "character. Things have happened there, and there are all sorts of queer\r\n",
      "people living there. And I went there about a scandalous business. It’s\r\n",
      "cheap, though...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I could not, of course, find out so much about it, for I am a stranger\r\n",
      "in Petersburg myself,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied huffily. “However, the\r\n",
      "two rooms are exceedingly clean, and as it is for so short a time...\r\n",
      "I have already taken a permanent, that is, our future flat,” he said,\r\n",
      "addressing Raskolnikov, “and I am having it done up. And meanwhile I am\r\n",
      "myself cramped for room in a lodging with my friend Andrey Semyonovitch\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov, in the flat of Madame Lippevechsel; it was he who told me\r\n",
      "of Bakaleyev’s house, too...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Lebeziatnikov?” said Raskolnikov slowly, as if recalling something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, a clerk in the Ministry. Do you\r\n",
      "know him?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... no,” Raskolnikov answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, I fancied so from your inquiry. I was once his guardian....\r\n",
      "A very nice young man and advanced. I like to meet young people: one\r\n",
      "learns new things from them.” Luzhin looked round hopefully at them all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you mean?” asked Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In the most serious and essential matters,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied,\r\n",
      "as though delighted at the question. “You see, it’s ten years since I\r\n",
      "visited Petersburg. All the novelties, reforms, ideas have reached us in\r\n",
      "the provinces, but to see it all more clearly one must be in Petersburg.\r\n",
      "And it’s my notion that you observe and learn most by watching the\r\n",
      "younger generation. And I confess I am delighted...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At what?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your question is a wide one. I may be mistaken, but I fancy I find\r\n",
      "clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s true,” Zossimov let drop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nonsense! There’s no practicality.” Razumihin flew at him.\r\n",
      "“Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from\r\n",
      "heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from\r\n",
      "all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,” he said to\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch, “and desire for good exists, though it’s in a childish\r\n",
      "form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands.\r\n",
      "Anyway, there’s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t agree with you,” Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident\r\n",
      "enjoyment. “Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes,\r\n",
      "but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of\r\n",
      "enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment. If little\r\n",
      "has been done, the time has been but short; of means I will not speak.\r\n",
      "It’s my personal view, if you care to know, that something has been\r\n",
      "accomplished already. New valuable ideas, new valuable works are\r\n",
      "circulating in the place of our old dreamy and romantic authors.\r\n",
      "Literature is taking a maturer form, many injurious prejudices have been\r\n",
      "rooted up and turned into ridicule.... In a word, we have cut ourselves\r\n",
      "off irrevocably from the past, and that, to my thinking, is a great\r\n",
      "thing...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s learnt it by heart to show off!” Raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?” asked Pyotr Petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received\r\n",
      "no reply.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s all true,” Zossimov hastened to interpose.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Isn’t it so?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, glancing affably at Zossimov.\r\n",
      "“You must admit,” he went on, addressing Razumihin with a shade of\r\n",
      "triumph and superciliousness--he almost added “young man”--“that there\r\n",
      "is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and\r\n",
      "economic truth...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“No, not a commonplace! Hitherto, for instance, if I were told, ‘love\r\n",
      "thy neighbour,’ what came of it?” Pyotr Petrovitch went on, perhaps with\r\n",
      "excessive haste. “It came to my tearing my coat in half to share with my\r\n",
      "neighbour and we both were left half naked. As a Russian proverb has\r\n",
      "it, ‘Catch several hares and you won’t catch one.’ Science now tells\r\n",
      "us, love yourself before all men, for everything in the world rests on\r\n",
      "self-interest. You love yourself and manage your own affairs properly\r\n",
      "and your coat remains whole. Economic truth adds that the better private\r\n",
      "affairs are organised in society--the more whole coats, so to say--the\r\n",
      "firmer are its foundations and the better is the common welfare\r\n",
      "organised too. Therefore, in acquiring wealth solely and exclusively for\r\n",
      "myself, I am acquiring, so to speak, for all, and helping to bring to\r\n",
      "pass my neighbour’s getting a little more than a torn coat; and that not\r\n",
      "from private, personal liberality, but as a consequence of the general\r\n",
      "advance. The idea is simple, but unhappily it has been a long time\r\n",
      "reaching us, being hindered by idealism and sentimentality. And yet it\r\n",
      "would seem to want very little wit to perceive it...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, I’ve very little wit myself,” Razumihin cut in sharply,\r\n",
      "“and so let us drop it. I began this discussion with an object, but I’ve\r\n",
      "grown so sick during the last three years of this chattering to amuse\r\n",
      "oneself, of this incessant flow of commonplaces, always the same, that,\r\n",
      "by Jove, I blush even when other people talk like that. You are in a\r\n",
      "hurry, no doubt, to exhibit your acquirements; and I don’t blame you,\r\n",
      "that’s quite pardonable. I only wanted to find out what sort of man you\r\n",
      "are, for so many unscrupulous people have got hold of the progressive\r\n",
      "cause of late and have so distorted in their own interests everything\r\n",
      "they touched, that the whole cause has been dragged in the mire. That’s\r\n",
      "enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me, sir,” said Luzhin, affronted, and speaking with excessive\r\n",
      "dignity. “Do you mean to suggest so unceremoniously that I too...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, my dear sir... how could I?... Come, that’s enough,” Razumihin\r\n",

      "conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you all off the scent. But I maintain that he is not cunning, not\r\n",
      "practised, and probably this was his first crime! The supposition that\r\n",
      "it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal doesn’t work. Suppose\r\n",
      "him to have been inexperienced, and it’s clear that it was only a chance\r\n",
      "that saved him--and chance may do anything. Why, he did not foresee\r\n",
      "obstacles, perhaps! And how did he set to work? He took jewels worth\r\n",
      "ten or twenty roubles, stuffing his pockets with them, ransacked the\r\n",
      "old woman’s trunks, her rags--and they found fifteen hundred roubles,\r\n",
      "besides notes, in a box in the top drawer of the chest! He did not know\r\n",

      "“You are talking of the murder of the old pawnbroker, I believe?” Pyotr\r\n",

      "in hand, but before departing he felt disposed to throw off a few more\r\n",

      "parcel which Razumihin had brought in that evening and had tied up again\r\n",
      "and began dressing. Strange to say, he seemed immediately to have become\r\n",
      "perfectly calm; not a trace of his recent delirium nor of the panic\r\n",
      "fear that had haunted him of late. It was the first moment of a strange\r\n",
      "sudden calm. His movements were precise and definite; a firm purpose was\r\n",
      "evident in them. “To-day, to-day,” he muttered to himself. He understood\r\n",
      "that he was still weak, but his intense spiritual concentration gave him\r\n",
      "strength and self-confidence. He hoped, moreover, that he would not\r\n",
      "fall down in the street. When he had dressed in entirely new clothes, he\r\n",
      "looked at the money lying on the table, and after a moment’s thought\r\n",
      "put it in his pocket. It was twenty-five roubles. He took also all the\r\n",
      "copper change from the ten roubles spent by Razumihin on the clothes.\r\n",
      "Then he softly unlatched the door, went out, slipped downstairs and\r\n",
      "glanced in at the open kitchen door. Nastasya was standing with her back\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was nearly eight o’clock, the sun was setting. It was as stifling as\r\n",
      "before, but he eagerly drank in the stinking, dusty town air. His head\r\n",
      "felt rather dizzy; a sort of savage energy gleamed suddenly in his\r\n",
      "feverish eyes and his wasted, pale and yellow face. He did not know and\r\n",
      "did not think where he was going, he had one thought only: “that all\r\n",

      "not return home without it, because he _would not go on living like\r\n",
      "that_.” How, with what to make an end? He had not an idea about it,\r\n",
      "he did not even want to think of it. He drove away thought; thought\r\n",
      "tortured him. All he knew, all he felt was that everything must be\r\n",

      "self-confidence and determination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From old habit he took his usual walk in the direction of the Hay\r\n",
      "Market. A dark-haired young man with a barrel organ was standing in\r\n",
      "the road in front of a little general shop and was grinding out a very\r\n",
      "sentimental song. He was accompanying a girl of fifteen, who stood\r\n",
      "on the pavement in front of him. She was dressed up in a crinoline, a\r\n",
      "mantle and a straw hat with a flame-coloured feather in it, all very\r\n",
      "old and shabby. In a strong and rather agreeable voice, cracked and\r\n",
      "coarsened by street singing, she sang in hope of getting a copper from\r\n",
      "the shop. Raskolnikov joined two or three listeners, took out a five\r\n",
      "copeck piece and put it in the girl’s hand. She broke off abruptly on a\r\n",
      "sentimental high note, shouted sharply to the organ grinder “Come on,”\r\n",
      " and both moved on to the next shop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you like street music?” said Raskolnikov, addressing a middle-aged\r\n",
      "man standing idly by him. The man looked at him, startled and wondering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I love to hear singing to a street organ,” said Raskolnikov, and his\r\n",
      "manner seemed strangely out of keeping with the subject--“I like it\r\n",
      "on cold, dark, damp autumn evenings--they must be damp--when all the\r\n",
      "passers-by have pale green, sickly faces, or better still when wet\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know.... Excuse me...” muttered the stranger, frightened by the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "they were not there now. Recognising the place, he stopped, looked round\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not a province, your excellency, but a district. Graciously\r\n",
      "forgive me, your excellency!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is that a tavern at the top there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "princesses there too.... La-la!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov crossed the square. In that corner there was a dense crowd\r\n",
      "of peasants. He pushed his way into the thickest part of it, looking\r\n",
      "at the faces. He felt an unaccountable inclination to enter into\r\n",
      "conversation with people. But the peasants took no notice of him; they\r\n",
      "were all shouting in groups together. He stood and thought a little and\r\n",
      "took a turning to the right in the direction of V.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had often crossed that little street which turns at an angle, leading\r\n",
      "from the market-place to Sadovy Street. Of late he had often felt drawn\r\n",
      "to wander about this district, when he felt depressed, that he might\r\n",
      "feel more so.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now he walked along, thinking of nothing. At that point there is a great\r\n",
      "block of buildings, entirely let out in dram shops and eating-houses;\r\n",
      "women were continually running in and out, bare-headed and in their\r\n",
      "indoor clothes. Here and there they gathered in groups, on the pavement,\r\n",
      "especially about the entrances to various festive establishments in\r\n",
      "the lower storeys. From one of these a loud din, sounds of singing, the\r\n",
      "tinkling of a guitar and shouts of merriment, floated into the street.\r\n",
      "A crowd of women were thronging round the door; some were sitting on the\r\n",
      "steps, others on the pavement, others were standing talking. A drunken\r\n",
      "soldier, smoking a cigarette, was walking near them in the road,\r\n",
      "swearing; he seemed to be trying to find his way somewhere, but had\r\n",
      "forgotten where. One beggar was quarrelling with another, and a man dead\r\n",
      "drunk was lying right across the road. Raskolnikov joined the throng of\r\n",
      "women, who were talking in husky voices. They were bare-headed and wore\r\n",
      "cotton dresses and goatskin shoes. There were women of forty and some\r\n",
      "not more than seventeen; almost all had blackened eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt strangely attracted by the singing and all the noise and\r\n",
      "uproar in the saloon below.... someone could be heard within dancing\r\n",
      "frantically, marking time with his heels to the sounds of the guitar\r\n",
      "and of a thin falsetto voice singing a jaunty air. He listened intently,\r\n",
      "gloomily and dreamily, bending down at the entrance and peeping\r\n",
      "inquisitively in from the pavement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "  “Oh, my handsome soldier\r\n",
      "   Don’t beat me for nothing,”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "trilled the thin voice of the singer. Raskolnikov felt a great desire to\r\n",
      "make out what he was singing, as though everything depended on that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I go in?” he thought. “They are laughing. From drink. Shall I get\r\n",
      "drunk?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Won’t you come in?” one of the women asked him. Her voice was\r\n",
      "still musical and less thick than the others, she was young and not\r\n",
      "repulsive--the only one of the group.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, she’s pretty,” he said, drawing himself up and looking at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She smiled, much pleased at the compliment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re very nice looking yourself,” she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Isn’t he thin though!” observed another woman in a deep bass. “Have you\r\n",
      "just come out of a hospital?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’re all generals’ daughters, it seems, but they have all snub\r\n",
      "noses,” interposed a tipsy peasant with a sly smile on his face, wearing\r\n",
      "a loose coat. “See how jolly they are.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll go, sweetie!”\r\n",

      "“I say, sir,” the girl shouted after him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?”\r\n",

      "She hesitated.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll always be pleased to spend an hour with you, kind gentleman, but\r\n",

      "man!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov gave her what came first--fifteen copecks.\r\n",

      "drop with shame....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked curiously at the speaker. She was a pock-marked wench\r\n",
      "of thirty, covered with bruises, with her upper lip swollen. She made\r\n",
      "her criticism quietly and earnestly. “Where is it,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "“Where is it I’ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks,\r\n",
      "an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock,\r\n",
      "on such a narrow ledge that he’d only room to stand, and the ocean,\r\n",
      "everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around\r\n",
      "him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his\r\n",
      "life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die\r\n",
      "at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!...\r\n",
      "How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile\r\n",
      "is he who calls him vile for that,” he added a moment later.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went into another street. “Bah, the Palais de Cristal! Razumihin\r\n",
      "was just talking of the Palais de Cristal. But what on earth was it\r\n",
      "I wanted? Yes, the newspapers.... Zossimov said he’d read it in the\r\n",
      "papers. Have you the papers?” he asked, going into a very spacious and\r\n",
      "positively clean restaurant, consisting of several rooms, which were,\r\n",
      "however, rather empty. Two or three people were drinking tea, and in a\r\n",
      "room further away were sitting four men drinking champagne. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "fancied that Zametov was one of them, but he could not be sure at that\r\n",
      "distance. “What if it is?” he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will you have vodka?” asked the waiter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Give me some tea and bring me the papers, the old ones for the last\r\n",
      "five days, and I’ll give you something.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir, here’s to-day’s. No vodka?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old newspapers and the tea were brought. Raskolnikov sat down and\r\n",
      "began to look through them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, damn... these are the items of intelligence. An accident on a\r\n",
      "staircase, spontaneous combustion of a shopkeeper from alcohol, a fire\r\n",
      "in Peski... a fire in the Petersburg quarter... another fire in the\r\n",
      "Petersburg quarter... and another fire in the Petersburg quarter....\r\n",
      "Ah, here it is!” He found at last what he was seeking and began to\r\n",
      "read it. The lines danced before his eyes, but he read it all and began\r\n",
      "eagerly seeking later additions in the following numbers. His hands\r\n",
      "shook with nervous impatience as he turned the sheets. Suddenly someone\r\n",
      "sat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk\r\n",
      "Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the\r\n",
      "watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the\r\n",
      "smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good\r\n",
      "humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark\r\n",
      "face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, you here?” he began in surprise, speaking as though he’d known\r\n",
      "him all his life. “Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were\r\n",
      "unconscious. How strange! And do you know I’ve been to see you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov knew he would come up to him. He laid aside the papers and\r\n",
      "turned to Zametov. There was a smile on his lips, and a new shade of\r\n",
      "irritable impatience was apparent in that smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know you have,” he answered. “I’ve heard it. You looked for my\r\n",
      "sock.... And you know Razumihin has lost his heart to you? He says\r\n",
      "you’ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna’s--you know, the woman you tried\r\n",
      "to befriend, for whom you winked to the Explosive Lieutenant and he\r\n",
      "would not understand. Do you remember? How could he fail to\r\n",
      "understand--it was quite clear, wasn’t it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a hot head he is!”\r\n",

      "“No, your friend Razumihin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must have a jolly life, Mr. Zametov; entrance free to the most\r\n",
      "agreeable places. Who’s been pouring champagne into you just now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We’ve just been... having a drink together.... You talk about pouring\r\n",
      "it into me!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By way of a fee! You profit by everything!” Raskolnikov laughed, “it’s\r\n",
      "all right, my dear boy,” he added, slapping Zametov on the shoulder. “I\r\n",
      "am not speaking from temper, but in a friendly way, for sport, as that\r\n",
      "workman of yours said when he was scuffling with Dmitri, in the case of\r\n",
      "the old woman....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How do you know about it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps I know more about it than you do.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How strange you are.... I am sure you are still very unwell. You\r\n",
      "oughtn’t to have come out.”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes. What are you doing, reading the papers?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s a lot about the fires.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I am not reading about the fires.” Here he looked mysteriously at\r\n",
      "Zametov; his lips were twisted again in a mocking smile. “No, I am not\r\n",
      "reading about the fires,” he went on, winking at Zametov. “But confess\r\n",
      "now, my dear fellow, you’re awfully anxious to know what I am reading\r\n",
      "about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am not in the least. Mayn’t I ask a question? Why do you keep\r\n",
      "on...?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, you are a man of culture and education?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was in the sixth class at the gymnasium,” said Zametov with some\r\n",
      "dignity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sixth class! Ah, my cock-sparrow! With your parting and your rings--you\r\n",
      "are a gentleman of fortune. Foo! what a charming boy!” Here Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "broke into a nervous laugh right in Zametov’s face. The latter drew\r\n",
      "back, more amazed than offended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Foo! how strange you are!” Zametov repeated very seriously. “I can’t\r\n",
      "help thinking you are still delirious.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am delirious? You are fibbing, my cock-sparrow! So I am strange? You\r\n",
      "find me curious, do you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, curious.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I tell you what I was reading about, what I was looking for? See\r\n",
      "what a lot of papers I’ve made them bring me. Suspicious, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what is it?”\r\n",

      "better ‘I confess’... No, that’s not right either; ‘I make a deposition\r\n",
      "and you take it.’ I depose that I was reading, that I was looking and\r\n",

      "came here on purpose to do it--for news of the murder of the old\r\n",
      "pawnbroker woman,” he articulated at last, almost in a whisper, bringing\r\n",
      "his face exceedingly close to the face of Zametov. Zametov looked at him\r\n",
      "steadily, without moving or drawing his face away. What struck Zametov\r\n",
      "afterwards as the strangest part of it all was that silence followed for\r\n",
      "exactly a minute, and that they gazed at one another all the while.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What if you have been reading about it?” he cried at last, perplexed\r\n",
      "and impatient. “That’s no business of mine! What of it?”\r\n",

      "heeding Zametov’s explanation, “about whom you were talking in the\r\n",

      "now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov’s set and earnest face was suddenly transformed, and he\r\n",
      "suddenly went off into the same nervous laugh as before, as though\r\n",
      "utterly unable to restrain himself. And in one flash he recalled with\r\n",
      "extraordinary vividness of sensation a moment in the recent past, that\r\n",
      "moment when he stood with the axe behind the door, while the latch\r\n",
      "trembled and the men outside swore and shook it, and he had a sudden\r\n",
      "desire to shout at them, to swear at them, to put out his tongue at\r\n",
      "them, to mock them, to laugh, and laugh, and laugh!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are either mad, or...” began Zametov, and he broke off, as though\r\n",
      "stunned by the idea that had suddenly flashed into his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Or? Or what? What? Come, tell me!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing,” said Zametov, getting angry, “it’s all nonsense!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both were silent. After his sudden fit of laughter Raskolnikov became\r\n",
      "suddenly thoughtful and melancholy. He put his elbow on the table and\r\n",
      "leaned his head on his hand. He seemed to have completely forgotten\r\n",
      "Zametov. The silence lasted for some time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why don’t you drink your tea? It’s getting cold,” said Zametov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! Tea? Oh, yes....” Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of\r\n",
      "bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember\r\n",
      "everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face\r\n",
      "resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There have been a great many of these crimes lately,” said Zametov.\r\n",
      "“Only the other day I read in the _Moscow News_ that a whole gang of\r\n",
      "false coiners had been caught in Moscow. It was a regular society. They\r\n",
      "used to forge tickets!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, but it was a long time ago! I read about it a month ago,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov answered calmly. “So you consider them criminals?” he added,\r\n",
      "smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course they are criminals.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred\r\n",
      "people meeting for such an object--what an idea! Three would be too\r\n",
      "many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in\r\n",
      "themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses.\r\n",
      "Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes--what\r\n",
      "a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these\r\n",
      "simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the\r\n",
      "rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his\r\n",
      "life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change\r\n",
      "the notes either; the man who changed the notes took five thousand\r\n",
      "roubles, and his hands trembled. He counted the first four thousand,\r\n",
      "but did not count the fifth thousand--he was in such a hurry to get the\r\n",
      "money into his pocket and run away. Of course he roused suspicion. And\r\n",
      "the whole thing came to a crash through one fool! Is it possible?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That his hands trembled?” observed Zametov, “yes, that’s quite\r\n",
      "possible. That, I feel quite sure, is possible. Sometimes one can’t\r\n",
      "stand things.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can’t stand that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, could you stand it then? No, I couldn’t. For the sake of a hundred\r\n",
      "roubles to face such a terrible experience? To go with false notes\r\n",
      "into a bank where it’s their business to spot that sort of thing! No, I\r\n",
      "should not have the face to do it. Would you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had an intense desire again “to put his tongue out.” Shivers\r\n",
      "kept running down his spine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should do it quite differently,” Raskolnikov began. “This is how I\r\n",
      "would change the notes: I’d count the first thousand three or four times\r\n",
      "backwards and forwards, looking at every note and then I’d set to the\r\n",
      "second thousand; I’d count that half-way through and then hold some\r\n",
      "fifty-rouble note to the light, then turn it, then hold it to the light\r\n",
      "again--to see whether it was a good one. ‘I am afraid,’ I would say, ‘a\r\n",
      "relation of mine lost twenty-five roubles the other day through a\r\n",
      "false note,’ and then I’d tell them the whole story. And after I began\r\n",
      "counting the third, ‘No, excuse me,’ I would say, ‘I fancy I made a\r\n",
      "mistake in the seventh hundred in that second thousand, I am not sure.’\r\n",
      "And so I would give up the third thousand and go back to the second and\r\n",
      "so on to the end. And when I had finished, I’d pick out one from the\r\n",
      "fifth and one from the second thousand and take them again to the light\r\n",
      "and ask again, ‘Change them, please,’ and put the clerk into such a stew\r\n",
      "that he would not know how to get rid of me. When I’d finished and had\r\n",
      "gone out, I’d come back, ‘No, excuse me,’ and ask for some explanation.\r\n",
      "That’s how I’d do it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Foo! what terrible things you say!” said Zametov, laughing. “But all\r\n",
      "that is only talk. I dare say when it came to deeds you’d make a slip.\r\n",
      "I believe that even a practised, desperate man cannot always reckon on\r\n",
      "himself, much less you and I. To take an example near home--that old\r\n",
      "woman murdered in our district. The murderer seems to have been a\r\n",
      "desperate fellow, he risked everything in open daylight, was saved by\r\n",
      "a miracle--but his hands shook, too. He did not succeed in robbing the\r\n",
      "place, he couldn’t stand it. That was clear from the...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov seemed offended.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“Well, they will catch him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who? You? Do you suppose you could catch him? You’ve a tough job! A\r\n",
      "great point for you is whether a man is spending money or not. If he had\r\n",
      "no money and suddenly begins spending, he must be the man. So that any\r\n",
      "child can mislead you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fact is they always do that, though,” answered Zametov. “A man will\r\n",
      "commit a clever murder at the risk of his life and then at once he goes\r\n",
      "drinking in a tavern. They are caught spending money, they are not all\r\n",
      "as cunning as you are. You wouldn’t go to a tavern, of course?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov frowned and looked steadily at Zametov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You seem to enjoy the subject and would like to know how I should\r\n",
      "behave in that case, too?” he asked with displeasure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like to,” Zametov answered firmly and seriously. Somewhat too\r\n",
      "much earnestness began to appear in his words and looks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very much?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very much!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All right then. This is how I should behave,” Raskolnikov began, again\r\n",
      "bringing his face close to Zametov’s, again staring at him and speaking\r\n",
      "in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. “This is what\r\n",
      "I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should\r\n",
      "have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place\r\n",
      "with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden\r\n",
      "or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone\r\n",
      "weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from\r\n",
      "the time the house was built. I would lift that stone--there would sure\r\n",
      "to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that\r\n",
      "hole. Then I’d roll the stone back so that it would look as before,\r\n",
      "would press it down with my foot and walk away. And for a year or two,\r\n",
      "three maybe, I would not touch it. And, well, they could search! There’d\r\n",
      "be no trace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a madman,” said Zametov, and for some reason he too spoke in a\r\n",
      "whisper, and moved away from Raskolnikov, whose eyes were glittering. He\r\n",
      "had turned fearfully pale and his upper lip was twitching and quivering.\r\n",
      "He bent down as close as possible to Zametov, and his lips began to move\r\n",
      "without uttering a word. This lasted for half a minute; he knew what he\r\n",
      "was doing, but could not restrain himself. The terrible word trembled on\r\n",
      "his lips, like the latch on that door; in another moment it will break\r\n",
      "out, in another moment he will let it go, he will speak out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what if it was I who murdered the old woman and Lizaveta?” he said\r\n",
      "suddenly and--realised what he had done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zametov looked wildly at him and turned white as the tablecloth. His\r\n",
      "face wore a contorted smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But is it possible?” he brought out faintly. Raskolnikov looked\r\n",
      "wrathfully at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Own up that you believed it, yes, you did?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not a bit of it, I believe it less than ever now,” Zametov cried\r\n",
      "hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve caught my cock-sparrow! So you did believe it before, if now you\r\n",
      "believe less than ever?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all,” cried Zametov, obviously embarrassed. “Have you been\r\n",
      "frightening me so as to lead up to this?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t believe it then? What were you talking about behind my\r\n",
      "back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive\r\n",
      "lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,” he shouted to the\r\n",
      "waiter, getting up and taking his cap, “how much?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thirty copecks,” the latter replied, running up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!” he\r\n",
      "held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. “Red notes and\r\n",
      "blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new\r\n",
      "clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You’ve cross-examined my\r\n",
      "landlady, I’ll be bound.... Well, that’s enough! _Assez causé!_ Till we\r\n",
      "meet again!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went out, trembling all over from a sort of wild hysterical\r\n",
      "sensation, in which there was an element of insufferable rapture. Yet he\r\n",
      "was gloomy and terribly tired. His face was twisted as after a fit.\r\n",
      "His fatigue increased rapidly. Any shock, any irritating sensation\r\n",
      "stimulated and revived his energies at once, but his strength failed as\r\n",
      "quickly when the stimulus was removed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zametov, left alone, sat for a long time in the same place, plunged in\r\n",
      "thought. Raskolnikov had unwittingly worked a revolution in his brain on\r\n",
      "a certain point and had made up his mind for him conclusively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ilya Petrovitch is a blockhead,” he decided.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had hardly opened the door of the restaurant when he\r\n",
      "stumbled against Razumihin on the steps. They did not see each other\r\n",
      "till they almost knocked against each other. For a moment they stood\r\n",
      "looking each other up and down. Razumihin was greatly astounded, then\r\n",
      "anger, real anger gleamed fiercely in his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So here you are!” he shouted at the top of his voice--“you ran away\r\n",
      "from your bed! And here I’ve been looking for you under the sofa! We\r\n",
      "went up to the garret. I almost beat Nastasya on your account. And here\r\n",
      "he is after all. Rodya! What is the meaning of it? Tell me the whole\r\n",
      "truth! Confess! Do you hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It means that I’m sick to death of you all and I want to be alone,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov answered calmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Alone? When you are not able to walk, when your face is as white as a\r\n",
      "sheet and you are gasping for breath! Idiot!... What have you been doing\r\n",
      "in the Palais de Cristal? Own up at once!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me go!” said Raskolnikov and tried to pass him. This was too much\r\n",
      "for Razumihin; he gripped him firmly by the shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let you go? You dare tell me to let you go? Do you know what I’ll do\r\n",
      "with you directly? I’ll pick you up, tie you up in a bundle, carry you\r\n",
      "home under my arm and lock you up!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, Razumihin,” Raskolnikov began quietly, apparently calm--“can’t\r\n",
      "you see that I don’t want your benevolence? A strange desire you have to\r\n",
      "shower benefits on a man who... curses them, who feels them a burden in\r\n",
      "fact! Why did you seek me out at the beginning of my illness? Maybe I\r\n",
      "was very glad to die. Didn’t I tell you plainly enough to-day that\r\n",
      "you were torturing me, that I was... sick of you! You seem to want to\r\n",
      "torture people! I assure you that all that is seriously hindering my\r\n",
      "recovery, because it’s continually irritating me. You saw Zossimov\r\n",
      "went away just now to avoid irritating me. You leave me alone too, for\r\n",
      "goodness’ sake! What right have you, indeed, to keep me by force? Don’t\r\n",
      "you see that I am in possession of all my faculties now? How, how can\r\n",
      "I persuade you not to persecute me with your kindness? I may be\r\n",
      "ungrateful, I may be mean, only let me be, for God’s sake, let me be!\r\n",
      "Let me be, let me be!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began calmly, gloating beforehand over the venomous phrases he was\r\n",
      "about to utter, but finished, panting for breath, in a frenzy, as he had\r\n",
      "been with Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin stood a moment, thought and let his hand drop.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, go to hell then,” he said gently and thoughtfully. “Stay,” he\r\n",
      "roared, as Raskolnikov was about to move. “Listen to me. Let me tell\r\n",
      "you, that you are all a set of babbling, posing idiots! If you’ve any\r\n",
      "little trouble you brood over it like a hen over an egg. And you are\r\n",
      "plagiarists even in that! There isn’t a sign of independent life in\r\n",
      "you! You are made of spermaceti ointment and you’ve lymph in your veins\r\n",
      "instead of blood. I don’t believe in anyone of you! In any circumstances\r\n",
      "the first thing for all of you is to be unlike a human being! Stop!” he\r\n",
      "cried with redoubled fury, noticing that Raskolnikov was again making\r\n",
      "a movement--“hear me out! You know I’m having a house-warming this\r\n",
      "evening, I dare say they’ve arrived by now, but I left my uncle there--I\r\n",
      "just ran in--to receive the guests. And if you weren’t a fool, a common\r\n",
      "fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation...\r\n",
      "you see, Rodya, I recognise you’re a clever fellow, but you’re a\r\n",
      "fool!--and if you weren’t a fool you’d come round to me this evening\r\n",
      "instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone\r\n",
      "out, there’s no help for it! I’d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady\r\n",
      "has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa--any\r\n",
      "way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“R-rubbish!” Razumihin shouted, out of patience. “How do you know?\r\n",
      "You can’t answer for yourself! You don’t know anything about it....\r\n",
      "Thousands of times I’ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back\r\n",
      "to them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So\r\n",

      "“I shall not come, Razumihin.” Raskolnikov turned and walked away.\r\n",

      "went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Confound it,” he went on almost aloud. “He talked sensibly but yet...\r\n",
      "I am a fool! As if madmen didn’t talk sensibly! And this was just what\r\n",
      "Zossimov seemed afraid of.” He struck his finger on his forehead. “What\r\n",
      "if... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach,\r\n",
      "what a blunder! I can’t.” And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but\r\n",
      "there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to\r\n",
      "the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked straight to X---- Bridge, stood in the middle, and\r\n",
      "leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. On parting\r\n",
      "with Razumihin, he felt so much weaker that he could scarcely reach this\r\n",
      "place. He longed to sit or lie down somewhere in the street. Bending\r\n",
      "over the water, he gazed mechanically at the last pink flush of the\r\n",
      "sunset, at the row of houses growing dark in the gathering twilight, at\r\n",
      "one distant attic window on the left bank, flashing as though on fire in\r\n",
      "the last rays of the setting sun, at the darkening water of the canal,\r\n",
      "and the water seemed to catch his attention. At last red circles flashed\r\n",
      "before his eyes, the houses seemed moving, the passers-by, the canal\r\n",
      "banks, the carriages, all danced before his eyes. Suddenly he started,\r\n",
      "saved again perhaps from swooning by an uncanny and hideous sight. He\r\n",
      "became aware of someone standing on the right side of him; he looked\r\n",
      "and saw a tall woman with a kerchief on her head, with a long, yellow,\r\n",
      "wasted face and red sunken eyes. She was looking straight at him, but\r\n",
      "obviously she saw nothing and recognised no one. Suddenly she leaned her\r\n",
      "right hand on the parapet, lifted her right leg over the railing, then\r\n",
      "her left and threw herself into the canal. The filthy water parted and\r\n",
      "swallowed up its victim for a moment, but an instant later the drowning\r\n",
      "woman floated to the surface, moving slowly with the current, her head\r\n",
      "and legs in the water, her skirt inflated like a balloon over her back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A woman drowning! A woman drowning!” shouted dozens of voices; people\r\n",
      "ran up, both banks were thronged with spectators, on the bridge people\r\n",
      "crowded about Raskolnikov, pressing up behind him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mercy on it! it’s our Afrosinya!” a woman cried tearfully close by.\r\n",
      "“Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A boat, a boat” was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a\r\n",
      "boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great\r\n",
      "coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her:\r\n",
      "she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of\r\n",
      "her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a\r\n",
      "comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They\r\n",
      "laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered\r\n",
      "consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing,\r\n",
      "stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’s drunk herself out of her senses,” the same woman’s voice wailed\r\n",
      "at her side. “Out of her senses. The other day she tried to hang\r\n",
      "herself, we cut her down. I ran out to the shop just now, left my little\r\n",
      "girl to look after her--and here she’s in trouble again! A neighbour,\r\n",
      "gentleman, a neighbour, we live close by, the second house from the end,\r\n",
      "see yonder....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The crowd broke up. The police still remained round the woman, someone\r\n",
      "mentioned the police station.... Raskolnikov looked on with a strange\r\n",
      "sensation of indifference and apathy. He felt disgusted. “No, that’s\r\n",
      "loathsome... water... it’s not good enough,” he muttered to himself.\r\n",
      "“Nothing will come of it,” he added, “no use to wait. What about the\r\n",
      "police office...? And why isn’t Zametov at the police office? The police\r\n",
      "office is open till ten o’clock....” He turned his back to the railing\r\n",
      "and looked about him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well then!” he said resolutely; he moved from the bridge and\r\n",
      "walked in the direction of the police office. His heart felt hollow and\r\n",
      "empty. He did not want to think. Even his depression had passed, there\r\n",
      "was not a trace now of the energy with which he had set out “to make an\r\n",
      "end of it all.” Complete apathy had succeeded to it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, it’s a way out of it,” he thought, walking slowly and listlessly\r\n",
      "along the canal bank. “Anyway I’ll make an end, for I want to.... But\r\n",
      "is it a way out? What does it matter! There’ll be the square yard of\r\n",
      "space--ha! But what an end! Is it really the end? Shall I tell them or\r\n",
      "not? Ah... damn! How tired I am! If I could find somewhere to sit or lie\r\n",
      "down soon! What I am most ashamed of is its being so stupid. But I don’t\r\n",
      "care about that either! What idiotic ideas come into one’s head.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To reach the police office he had to go straight forward and take the\r\n",
      "second turning to the left. It was only a few paces away. But at the\r\n",
      "first turning he stopped and, after a minute’s thought, turned into a\r\n",
      "side street and went two streets out of his way, possibly without any\r\n",
      "object, or possibly to delay a minute and gain time. He walked, looking\r\n",
      "at the ground; suddenly someone seemed to whisper in his ear; he lifted\r\n",
      "his head and saw that he was standing at the very gate of _the_ house.\r\n",
      "He had not passed it, he had not been near it since _that_ evening.\r\n",
      "An overwhelming, unaccountable prompting drew him on. He went into the\r\n",
      "house, passed through the gateway, then into the first entrance on the\r\n",
      "right, and began mounting the familiar staircase to the fourth storey.\r\n",
      "The narrow, steep staircase was very dark. He stopped at each landing\r\n",
      "and looked round him with curiosity; on the first landing the framework\r\n",
      "of the window had been taken out. “That wasn’t so then,” he thought.\r\n",
      "Here was the flat on the second storey where Nikolay and Dmitri had been\r\n",
      "working. “It’s shut up and the door newly painted. So it’s to let.” Then\r\n",
      "the third storey and the fourth. “Here!” He was perplexed to find the\r\n",
      "door of the flat wide open. There were men there, he could hear voices;\r\n",
      "he had not expected that. After brief hesitation he mounted the last\r\n",
      "stairs and went into the flat. It, too, was being done up; there were\r\n",
      "workmen in it. This seemed to amaze him; he somehow fancied that he\r\n",
      "would find everything as he left it, even perhaps the corpses in the\r\n",
      "same places on the floor. And now, bare walls, no furniture; it seemed\r\n",
      "strange. He walked to the window and sat down on the window-sill. There\r\n",
      "were two workmen, both young fellows, but one much younger than the\r\n",
      "other. They were papering the walls with a new white paper covered with\r\n",
      "lilac flowers, instead of the old, dirty, yellow one. Raskolnikov for\r\n",
      "some reason felt horribly annoyed by this. He looked at the new paper\r\n",
      "with dislike, as though he felt sorry to have it all so changed.\r\n",
      "The workmen had obviously stayed beyond their time and now they were\r\n",
      "hurriedly rolling up their paper and getting ready to go home. They took\r\n",
      "no notice of Raskolnikov’s coming in; they were talking. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "folded his arms and listened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She comes to me in the morning,” said the elder to the younger, “very\r\n",
      "early, all dressed up. ‘Why are you preening and prinking?’ says I. ‘I\r\n",
      "am ready to do anything to please you, Tit Vassilitch!’ That’s a way of\r\n",
      "going on! And she dressed up like a regular fashion book!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what is a fashion book?” the younger one asked. He obviously\r\n",
      "regarded the other as an authority.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A fashion book is a lot of pictures, coloured, and they come to the\r\n",
      "tailors here every Saturday, by post from abroad, to show folks how\r\n",
      "to dress, the male sex as well as the female. They’re pictures. The\r\n",
      "gentlemen are generally wearing fur coats and for the ladies’ fluffles,\r\n",
      "they’re beyond anything you can fancy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There’s nothing you can’t find in Petersburg,” the younger cried\r\n",
      "enthusiastically, “except father and mother, there’s everything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Except them, there’s everything to be found, my boy,” the elder\r\n",
      "declared sententiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov got up and walked into the other room where the strong box,\r\n",
      "the bed, and the chest of drawers had been; the room seemed to him very\r\n",
      "tiny without furniture in it. The paper was the same; the paper in the\r\n",
      "corner showed where the case of ikons had stood. He looked at it and\r\n",
      "went to the window. The elder workman looked at him askance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” he asked suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instead of answering Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the\r\n",
      "bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and\r\n",
      "a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonisingly\r\n",
      "fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back more and more\r\n",
      "vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more\r\n",
      "satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what do you want? Who are you?” the workman shouted, going out to\r\n",
      "him. Raskolnikov went inside again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I want to take a flat,” he said. “I am looking round.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not the time to look at rooms at night! and you ought to come up\r\n",
      "with the porter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The floors have been washed, will they be painted?” Raskolnikov went\r\n",
      "on. “Is there no blood?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What blood?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, the old woman and her sister were murdered here. There was a\r\n",
      "perfect pool there.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But who are you?” the workman cried, uneasy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who am I?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You want to know? Come to the police station, I’ll tell you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The workmen looked at him in amazement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s time for us to go, we are late. Come along, Alyoshka. We must lock\r\n",
      "up,” said the elder workman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very well, come along,” said Raskolnikov indifferently, and going\r\n",
      "out first, he went slowly downstairs. “Hey, porter,” he cried in the\r\n",
      "gateway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the entrance several people were standing, staring at the passers-by;\r\n",
      "the two porters, a peasant woman, a man in a long coat and a few others.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went straight up to them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” asked one of the porters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you been to the police office?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve just been there. What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it open?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is the assistant there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He was there for a time. What do you want?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov made no reply, but stood beside them lost in thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s been to look at the flat,” said the elder workman, coming forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which flat?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where we are at work. ‘Why have you washed away the blood?’ says he.\r\n",
      "‘There has been a murder here,’ says he, ‘and I’ve come to take it.’\r\n",
      "And he began ringing at the bell, all but broke it. ‘Come to the police\r\n",
      "station,’ says he. ‘I’ll tell you everything there.’ He wouldn’t leave\r\n",
      "us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The porter looked at Raskolnikov, frowning and perplexed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who are you?” he shouted as impressively as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am Rodion Romanovitch Raskolnikov, formerly a student, I live in\r\n",
      "Shil’s house, not far from here, flat Number 14, ask the porter, he\r\n",
      "knows me.” Raskolnikov said all this in a lazy, dreamy voice, not\r\n",
      "turning round, but looking intently into the darkening street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why have you been to the flat?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To look at it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is there to look at?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take him straight to the police station,” the man in the long coat\r\n",
      "jerked in abruptly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked intently at him over his shoulder and said in the\r\n",
      "same slow, lazy tones:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come along.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, take him,” the man went on more confidently. “Why was he going\r\n",
      "into _that_, what’s in his mind, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s not drunk, but God knows what’s the matter with him,” muttered the\r\n",
      "workman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what do you want?” the porter shouted again, beginning to get angry\r\n",
      "in earnest--“Why are you hanging about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You funk the police station then?” said Raskolnikov jeeringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How funk it? Why are you hanging about?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s a rogue!” shouted the peasant woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why waste time talking to him?” cried the other porter, a huge peasant\r\n",
      "in a full open coat and with keys on his belt. “Get along! He is a rogue\r\n",
      "and no mistake. Get along!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And seizing Raskolnikov by the shoulder he flung him into the street. He\r\n",
      "lurched forward, but recovered his footing, looked at the spectators in\r\n",
      "silence and walked away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Strange man!” observed the workman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are strange folks about nowadays,” said the woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You should have taken him to the police station all the same,” said the\r\n",
      "man in the long coat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Better have nothing to do with him,” decided the big porter. “A regular\r\n",
      "rogue! Just what he wants, you may be sure, but once take him up, you\r\n",
      "won’t get rid of him.... We know the sort!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall I go there or not?” thought Raskolnikov, standing in the middle\r\n",
      "of the thoroughfare at the cross-roads, and he looked about him, as\r\n",
      "though expecting from someone a decisive word. But no sound came, all\r\n",
      "was dead and silent like the stones on which he walked, dead to him, to\r\n",
      "him alone.... All at once at the end of the street, two hundred yards\r\n",
      "away, in the gathering dusk he saw a crowd and heard talk and shouts.\r\n",
      "In the middle of the crowd stood a carriage.... A light gleamed in the\r\n",
      "middle of the street. “What is it?” Raskolnikov turned to the right\r\n",
      "and went up to the crowd. He seemed to clutch at everything and smiled\r\n",
      "coldly when he recognised it, for he had fully made up his mind to go to\r\n",
      "the police station and knew that it would all soon be over.\r\n",

      "CHAPTER VII\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An elegant carriage stood in the middle of the road with a pair of\r\n",
      "spirited grey horses; there was no one in it, and the coachman had got\r\n",
      "off his box and stood by; the horses were being held by the bridle....\r\n",
      "A mass of people had gathered round, the police standing in front. One\r\n",
      "of them held a lighted lantern which he was turning on something lying\r\n",
      "close to the wheels. Everyone was talking, shouting, exclaiming; the\r\n",
      "coachman seemed at a loss and kept repeating:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a misfortune! Good Lord, what a misfortune!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov pushed his way in as far as he could, and succeeded at last\r\n",
      "in seeing the object of the commotion and interest. On the ground a\r\n",
      "man who had been run over lay apparently unconscious, and covered with\r\n",
      "blood; he was very badly dressed, but not like a workman. Blood was\r\n",
      "flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and\r\n",
      "disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Merciful heaven!” wailed the coachman, “what more could I do? If I’d\r\n",
      "been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly,\r\n",
      "not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody\r\n",
      "else. A drunken man can’t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him\r\n",
      "crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again\r\n",
      "and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell\r\n",
      "straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very\r\n",
      "tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started,\r\n",
      "he screamed... that made them worse. That’s how it happened!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just how it was,” a voice in the crowd confirmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He shouted, that’s true, he shouted three times,” another voice\r\n",
      "declared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Three times it was, we all heard it,” shouted a third.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the coachman was not very much distressed and frightened. It was\r\n",
      "evident that the carriage belonged to a rich and important person who\r\n",
      "was awaiting it somewhere; the police, of course, were in no little\r\n",
      "anxiety to avoid upsetting his arrangements. All they had to do was to\r\n",
      "take the injured man to the police station and the hospital. No one knew\r\n",
      "his name.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Raskolnikov had squeezed in and stooped closer over him. The\r\n",
      "lantern suddenly lighted up the unfortunate man’s face. He recognised\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know him! I know him!” he shouted, pushing to the front. “It’s a\r\n",
      "government clerk retired from the service, Marmeladov. He lives close\r\n",
      "by in Kozel’s house.... Make haste for a doctor! I will pay, see?” He\r\n",
      "pulled money out of his pocket and showed it to the policeman. He was in\r\n",
      "violent agitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The police were glad that they had found out who the man was.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov gave his own name and address, and, as earnestly as if it\r\n",
      "had been his father, he besought the police to carry the unconscious\r\n",
      "Marmeladov to his lodging at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Just here, three houses away,” he said eagerly, “the house belongs to\r\n",
      "Kozel, a rich German. He was going home, no doubt drunk. I know him,\r\n",
      "he is a drunkard. He has a family there, a wife, children, he has one\r\n",
      "daughter.... It will take time to take him to the hospital, and there is\r\n",
      "sure to be a doctor in the house. I’ll pay, I’ll pay! At least he will\r\n",
      "be looked after at home... they will help him at once. But he’ll die\r\n",
      "before you get him to the hospital.” He managed to slip something\r\n",
      "unseen into the policeman’s hand. But the thing was straightforward\r\n",
      "and legitimate, and in any case help was closer here. They raised the\r\n",
      "injured man; people volunteered to help.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Kozel’s house was thirty yards away. Raskolnikov walked behind,\r\n",
      "carefully holding Marmeladov’s head and showing the way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This way, this way! We must take him upstairs head foremost. Turn\r\n",

      "Katerina Ivanovna had just begun, as she always did at every free\r\n",
      "moment, walking to and fro in her little room from window to stove and\r\n",
      "back again, with her arms folded across her chest, talking to herself\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You wouldn’t believe, you can’t imagine, Polenka,” she said, walking\r\n",
      "about the room, “what a happy luxurious life we had in my papa’s house\r\n",
      "and how this drunkard has brought me, and will bring you all, to ruin!\r\n",
      "Papa was a civil colonel and only a step from being a governor; so that\r\n",
      "everyone who came to see him said, ‘We look upon you, Ivan Mihailovitch,\r\n",
      "as our governor!’ When I... when...” she coughed violently, “oh, cursed\r\n",
      "life,” she cried, clearing her throat and pressing her hands to her\r\n",
      "breast, “when I... when at the last ball... at the marshal’s...\r\n",
      "Princess Bezzemelny saw me--who gave me the blessing when your father\r\n",
      "and I were married, Polenka--she asked at once ‘Isn’t that the pretty\r\n",
      "girl who danced the shawl dance at the breaking-up?’ (You must mend\r\n",
      "that tear, you must take your needle and darn it as I showed you, or\r\n",
      "to-morrow--cough, cough, cough--he will make the hole bigger,” she\r\n",
      "articulated with effort.) “Prince Schegolskoy, a kammerjunker, had just\r\n",
      "come from Petersburg then... he danced the mazurka with me and wanted to\r\n",
      "make me an offer next day; but I thanked him in flattering expressions\r\n",
      "and told him that my heart had long been another’s. That other was your\r\n",
      "father, Polya; papa was fearfully angry.... Is the water ready? Give me\r\n",
      "the shirt, and the stockings! Lida,” said she to the youngest one, “you\r\n",
      "must manage without your chemise to-night... and lay your stockings out\r\n",
      "with it... I’ll wash them together.... How is it that drunken vagabond\r\n",
      "doesn’t come in? He has worn his shirt till it looks like a dish-clout,\r\n",
      "he has torn it to rags! I’d do it all together, so as not to have to\r\n",
      "work two nights running! Oh, dear! (Cough, cough, cough, cough!) Again!\r\n",
      "What’s this?” she cried, noticing a crowd in the passage and the men,\r\n",
      "who were pushing into her room, carrying a burden. “What is it? What are\r\n",
      "they bringing? Mercy on us!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are we to put him?” asked the policeman, looking round when\r\n",
      "Marmeladov, unconscious and covered with blood, had been carried in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On the sofa! Put him straight on the sofa, with his head this way,”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov showed him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Run over in the road! Drunk!” someone shouted in the passage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna stood, turning white and gasping for breath. The\r\n",
      "children were terrified. Little Lida screamed, rushed to Polenka and\r\n",
      "clutched at her, trembling all over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Having laid Marmeladov down, Raskolnikov flew to Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“For God’s sake be calm, don’t be frightened!” he said, speaking\r\n",
      "quickly, “he was crossing the road and was run over by a carriage, don’t\r\n",
      "be frightened, he will come to, I told them bring him here... I’ve been\r\n",
      "here already, you remember? He will come to; I’ll pay!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s done it this time!” Katerina Ivanovna cried despairingly and she\r\n",
      "rushed to her husband.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov noticed at once that she was not one of those women who\r\n",
      "swoon easily. She instantly placed under the luckless man’s head a\r\n",
      "pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining\r\n",
      "him. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips\r\n",
      "and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a\r\n",
      "doctor, it appeared, next door but one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve sent for a doctor,” he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, “don’t be\r\n",
      "uneasy, I’ll pay. Haven’t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel,\r\n",
      "anything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe\r\n",
      "me.... We shall see what the doctor says!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna ran to the window; there, on a broken chair in the\r\n",
      "corner, a large earthenware basin full of water had been stood, in\r\n",
      "readiness for washing her children’s and husband’s linen that night.\r\n",
      "This washing was done by Katerina Ivanovna at night at least twice a\r\n",
      "week, if not oftener. For the family had come to such a pass that they\r\n",
      "were practically without change of linen, and Katerina Ivanovna could\r\n",
      "not endure uncleanliness and, rather than see dirt in the house, she\r\n",
      "preferred to wear herself out at night, working beyond her strength when\r\n",
      "the rest were asleep, so as to get the wet linen hung on a line and dry\r\n",
      "by the morning. She took up the basin of water at Raskolnikov’s request,\r\n",
      "but almost fell down with her burden. But the latter had already\r\n",
      "succeeded in finding a towel, wetted it and began washing the blood off\r\n",
      "Marmeladov’s face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna stood by, breathing painfully and pressing her hands\r\n",
      "to her breast. She was in need of attention herself. Raskolnikov began\r\n",
      "to realise that he might have made a mistake in having the injured man\r\n",
      "brought here. The policeman, too, stood in hesitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Polenka,” cried Katerina Ivanovna, “run to Sonia, make haste. If you\r\n",
      "don’t find her at home, leave word that her father has been run over\r\n",
      "and that she is to come here at once... when she comes in. Run, Polenka!\r\n",
      "there, put on the shawl.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Run your fastest!” cried the little boy on the chair suddenly, after\r\n",
      "which he relapsed into the same dumb rigidity, with round eyes, his\r\n",
      "heels thrust forward and his toes spread out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile the room had become so full of people that you couldn’t have\r\n",
      "dropped a pin. The policemen left, all except one, who remained for a\r\n",
      "time, trying to drive out the people who came in from the stairs. Almost\r\n",
      "all Madame Lippevechsel’s lodgers had streamed in from the inner rooms\r\n",
      "of the flat; at first they were squeezed together in the doorway, but\r\n",
      "afterwards they overflowed into the room. Katerina Ivanovna flew into a\r\n",
      "fury.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You might let him die in peace, at least,” she shouted at the crowd,\r\n",
      "“is it a spectacle for you to gape at? With cigarettes! (Cough, cough,\r\n",
      "cough!) You might as well keep your hats on.... And there is one in his\r\n",
      "hat!... Get away! You should respect the dead, at least!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her cough choked her--but her reproaches were not without result. They\r\n",
      "evidently stood in some awe of Katerina Ivanovna. The lodgers, one after\r\n",
      "another, squeezed back into the doorway with that strange inner feeling\r\n",
      "of satisfaction which may be observed in the presence of a sudden\r\n",
      "accident, even in those nearest and dearest to the victim, from which\r\n",
      "no living man is exempt, even in spite of the sincerest sympathy and\r\n",
      "compassion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Voices outside were heard, however, speaking of the hospital and saying\r\n",
      "that they’d no business to make a disturbance here.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No business to die!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, and she was rushing to\r\n",
      "the door to vent her wrath upon them, but in the doorway came face to\r\n",
      "face with Madame Lippevechsel who had only just heard of the accident\r\n",
      "and ran in to restore order. She was a particularly quarrelsome and\r\n",
      "irresponsible German.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, my God!” she cried, clasping her hands, “your husband drunken\r\n",
      "horses have trampled! To the hospital with him! I am the landlady!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Amalia Ludwigovna, I beg you to recollect what you are saying,”\r\n",
      " Katerina Ivanovna began haughtily (she always took a haughty tone with\r\n",
      "the landlady that she might “remember her place” and even now could not\r\n",
      "deny herself this satisfaction). “Amalia Ludwigovna...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have you once before told that you to call me Amalia Ludwigovna may\r\n",
      "not dare; I am Amalia Ivanovna.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are not Amalia Ivanovna, but Amalia Ludwigovna, and as I am not\r\n",
      "one of your despicable flatterers like Mr. Lebeziatnikov, who’s laughing\r\n",
      "behind the door at this moment (a laugh and a cry of ‘they are at it\r\n",
      "again’ was in fact audible at the door) so I shall always call you\r\n",
      "Amalia Ludwigovna, though I fail to understand why you dislike that\r\n",
      "name. You can see for yourself what has happened to Semyon Zaharovitch;\r\n",
      "he is dying. I beg you to close that door at once and to admit no one.\r\n",
      "Let him at least die in peace! Or I warn you the Governor-General,\r\n",
      "himself, shall be informed of your conduct to-morrow. The prince knew\r\n",
      "me as a girl; he remembers Semyon Zaharovitch well and has often been\r\n",
      "a benefactor to him. Everyone knows that Semyon Zaharovitch had many\r\n",
      "friends and protectors, whom he abandoned himself from an honourable\r\n",
      "pride, knowing his unhappy weakness, but now (she pointed to\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov) a generous young man has come to our assistance, who has\r\n",
      "wealth and connections and whom Semyon Zaharovitch has known from a\r\n",
      "child. You may rest assured, Amalia Ludwigovna...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this was uttered with extreme rapidity, getting quicker and quicker,\r\n",
      "but a cough suddenly cut short Katerina Ivanovna’s eloquence. At that\r\n",
      "instant the dying man recovered consciousness and uttered a groan; she\r\n",
      "ran to him. The injured man opened his eyes and without recognition or\r\n",
      "understanding gazed at Raskolnikov who was bending over him. He drew\r\n",
      "deep, slow, painful breaths; blood oozed at the corners of his mouth\r\n",
      "and drops of perspiration came out on his forehead. Not recognising\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, he began looking round uneasily. Katerina Ivanovna looked\r\n",
      "at him with a sad but stern face, and tears trickled from her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My God! His whole chest is crushed! How he is bleeding,” she said\r\n",
      "in despair. “We must take off his clothes. Turn a little, Semyon\r\n",
      "Zaharovitch, if you can,” she cried to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov recognised her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A priest,” he articulated huskily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna walked to the window, laid her head against the window\r\n",
      "frame and exclaimed in despair:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, cursed life!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A priest,” the dying man said again after a moment’s silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They’ve gone for him,” Katerina Ivanovna shouted to him, he obeyed her\r\n",
      "shout and was silent. With sad and timid eyes he looked for her; she\r\n",
      "returned and stood by his pillow. He seemed a little easier but not for\r\n",
      "long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon his eyes rested on little Lida, his favourite, who was shaking in\r\n",
      "the corner, as though she were in a fit, and staring at him with her\r\n",
      "wondering childish eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ah,” he signed towards her uneasily. He wanted to say something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What now?” cried Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Barefoot, barefoot!” he muttered, indicating with frenzied eyes the\r\n",
      "child’s bare feet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent,” Katerina Ivanovna cried irritably, “you know why she is\r\n",
      "barefooted.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank God, the doctor,” exclaimed Raskolnikov, relieved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor came in, a precise little old man, a German, looking about\r\n",
      "him mistrustfully; he went up to the sick man, took his pulse, carefully\r\n",
      "felt his head and with the help of Katerina Ivanovna he unbuttoned the\r\n",
      "blood-stained shirt, and bared the injured man’s chest. It was gashed,\r\n",
      "crushed and fractured, several ribs on the right side were broken.\r\n",
      "On the left side, just over the heart, was a large, sinister-looking\r\n",
      "yellowish-black bruise--a cruel kick from the horse’s hoof. The doctor\r\n",
      "frowned. The policeman told him that he was caught in the wheel and\r\n",
      "turned round with it for thirty yards on the road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s wonderful that he has recovered consciousness,” the doctor\r\n",
      "whispered softly to Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you think of him?” he asked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He will die immediately.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there really no hope?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not the faintest! He is at the last gasp.... His head is badly injured,\r\n",
      "too... Hm... I could bleed him if you like, but... it would be useless.\r\n",
      "He is bound to die within the next five or ten minutes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Better bleed him then.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you like.... But I warn you it will be perfectly useless.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment other steps were heard; the crowd in the passage parted,\r\n",
      "and the priest, a little, grey old man, appeared in the doorway bearing\r\n",
      "the sacrament. A policeman had gone for him at the time of the accident.\r\n",
      "The doctor changed places with him, exchanging glances with him.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov begged the doctor to remain a little while. He shrugged his\r\n",
      "shoulders and remained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All stepped back. The confession was soon over. The dying man probably\r\n",
      "understood little; he could only utter indistinct broken sounds.\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna took little Lida, lifted the boy from the chair, knelt\r\n",
      "down in the corner by the stove and made the children kneel in front of\r\n",
      "her. The little girl was still trembling; but the boy, kneeling on his\r\n",
      "little bare knees, lifted his hand rhythmically, crossing himself with\r\n",
      "precision and bowed down, touching the floor with his forehead, which\r\n",
      "seemed to afford him especial satisfaction. Katerina Ivanovna bit her\r\n",
      "lips and held back her tears; she prayed, too, now and then pulling\r\n",
      "straight the boy’s shirt, and managed to cover the girl’s bare shoulders\r\n",
      "with a kerchief, which she took from the chest without rising from her\r\n",
      "knees or ceasing to pray. Meanwhile the door from the inner rooms was\r\n",
      "opened inquisitively again. In the passage the crowd of spectators from\r\n",
      "all the flats on the staircase grew denser and denser, but they did not\r\n",
      "venture beyond the threshold. A single candle-end lighted up the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment Polenka forced her way through the crowd at the door. She\r\n",
      "came in panting from running so fast, took off her kerchief, looked for\r\n",
      "her mother, went up to her and said, “She’s coming, I met her in the\r\n",
      "street.” Her mother made her kneel beside her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Timidly and noiselessly a young girl made her way through the crowd,\r\n",
      "and strange was her appearance in that room, in the midst of want, rags,\r\n",
      "death and despair. She, too, was in rags, her attire was all of\r\n",
      "the cheapest, but decked out in gutter finery of a special stamp,\r\n",
      "unmistakably betraying its shameful purpose. Sonia stopped short in the\r\n",
      "doorway and looked about her bewildered, unconscious of everything.\r\n",
      "She forgot her fourth-hand, gaudy silk dress, so unseemly here with\r\n",
      "its ridiculous long train, and her immense crinoline that filled up the\r\n",
      "whole doorway, and her light-coloured shoes, and the parasol she brought\r\n",
      "with her, though it was no use at night, and the absurd round straw hat\r\n",
      "with its flaring flame-coloured feather. Under this rakishly-tilted hat\r\n",
      "was a pale, frightened little face with lips parted and eyes staring in\r\n",
      "terror. Sonia was a small thin girl of eighteen with fair hair, rather\r\n",
      "pretty, with wonderful blue eyes. She looked intently at the bed and the\r\n",
      "priest; she too was out of breath with running. At last whispers, some\r\n",
      "words in the crowd probably, reached her. She looked down and took a\r\n",
      "step forward into the room, still keeping close to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The service was over. Katerina Ivanovna went up to her husband again.\r\n",
      "The priest stepped back and turned to say a few words of admonition and\r\n",
      "consolation to Katerina Ivanovna on leaving.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What am I to do with these?” she interrupted sharply and irritably,\r\n",
      "pointing to the little ones.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God is merciful; look to the Most High for succour,” the priest began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach! He is merciful, but not to us.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a sin, a sin, madam,” observed the priest, shaking his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And isn’t that a sin?” cried Katerina Ivanovna, pointing to the dying\r\n",
      "man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps those who have involuntarily caused the accident will agree to\r\n",
      "compensate you, at least for the loss of his earnings.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t understand!” cried Katerina Ivanovna angrily waving her hand.\r\n",
      "“And why should they compensate me? Why, he was drunk and threw himself\r\n",
      "under the horses! What earnings? He brought us in nothing but misery.\r\n",
      "He drank everything away, the drunkard! He robbed us to get drink, he\r\n",
      "wasted their lives and mine for drink! And thank God he’s dying! One\r\n",
      "less to keep!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must forgive in the hour of death, that’s a sin, madam, such\r\n",
      "feelings are a great sin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna was busy with the dying man; she was giving him water,\r\n",
      "wiping the blood and sweat from his head, setting his pillow straight,\r\n",
      "and had only turned now and then for a moment to address the priest. Now\r\n",
      "she flew at him almost in a frenzy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, father! That’s words and only words! Forgive! If he’d not been run\r\n",
      "over, he’d have come home to-day drunk and his only shirt dirty and\r\n",
      "in rags and he’d have fallen asleep like a log, and I should have been\r\n",
      "sousing and rinsing till daybreak, washing his rags and the children’s\r\n",
      "and then drying them by the window and as soon as it was daylight I\r\n",
      "should have been darning them. That’s how I spend my nights!... What’s\r\n",
      "the use of talking of forgiveness! I have forgiven as it is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A terrible hollow cough interrupted her words. She put her handkerchief\r\n",
      "to her lips and showed it to the priest, pressing her other hand to her\r\n",
      "aching chest. The handkerchief was covered with blood. The priest bowed\r\n",
      "his head and said nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Marmeladov was in the last agony; he did not take his eyes off the face\r\n",
      "of Katerina Ivanovna, who was bending over him again. He kept trying\r\n",
      "to say something to her; he began moving his tongue with difficulty and\r\n",
      "articulating indistinctly, but Katerina Ivanovna, understanding that he\r\n",
      "wanted to ask her forgiveness, called peremptorily to him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent! No need! I know what you want to say!” And the sick man\r\n",
      "was silent, but at the same instant his wandering eyes strayed to the\r\n",
      "doorway and he saw Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Till then he had not noticed her: she was standing in the shadow in a\r\n",
      "corner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who’s that? Who’s that?” he said suddenly in a thick gasping voice,\r\n",
      "in agitation, turning his eyes in horror towards the door where his\r\n",
      "daughter was standing, and trying to sit up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "With unnatural strength he had succeeded in propping himself on his\r\n",
      "elbow. He looked wildly and fixedly for some time on his daughter, as\r\n",
      "though not recognising her. He had never seen her before in such attire.\r\n",
      "Suddenly he recognised her, crushed and ashamed in her humiliation and\r\n",
      "gaudy finery, meekly awaiting her turn to say good-bye to her dying\r\n",
      "father. His face showed intense suffering.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia! Daughter! Forgive!” he cried, and he tried to hold out his hand\r\n",
      "to her, but losing his balance, he fell off the sofa, face downwards on\r\n",
      "the floor. They rushed to pick him up, they put him on the sofa; but he\r\n",
      "was dying. Sonia with a faint cry ran up, embraced him and remained so\r\n",
      "without moving. He died in her arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s got what he wanted,” Katerina Ivanovna cried, seeing her husband’s\r\n",
      "dead body. “Well, what’s to be done now? How am I to bury him! What can\r\n",
      "I give them to-morrow to eat?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Katerina Ivanovna,” he began, “last week your husband told me all his\r\n",
      "life and circumstances.... Believe me, he spoke of you with passionate\r\n",
      "reverence. From that evening, when I learnt how devoted he was to you\r\n",
      "all and how he loved and respected you especially, Katerina Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "in spite of his unfortunate weakness, from that evening we became\r\n",
      "friends.... Allow me now... to do something... to repay my debt to my\r\n",
      "dead friend. Here are twenty roubles, I think--and if that can be of any\r\n",
      "assistance to you, then... I... in short, I will come again, I will\r\n",
      "be sure to come again... I shall, perhaps, come again to-morrow....\r\n",
      "Good-bye!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he went quickly out of the room, squeezing his way through the crowd\r\n",
      "to the stairs. But in the crowd he suddenly jostled against Nikodim\r\n",
      "Fomitch, who had heard of the accident and had come to give instructions\r\n",
      "in person. They had not met since the scene at the police station, but\r\n",
      "Nikodim Fomitch knew him instantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, is that you?” he asked him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s dead,” answered Raskolnikov. “The doctor and the priest have been,\r\n",
      "all as it should have been. Don’t worry the poor woman too much, she is\r\n",
      "in consumption as it is. Try and cheer her up, if possible... you are a\r\n",
      "kind-hearted man, I know...” he added with a smile, looking straight in\r\n",
      "his face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you are spattered with blood,” observed Nikodim Fomitch, noticing\r\n",
      "in the lamplight some fresh stains on Raskolnikov’s waistcoat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... I’m covered with blood,” Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air;\r\n",
      "then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious\r\n",
      "of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and\r\n",
      "strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be\r\n",
      "compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been\r\n",
      "pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on\r\n",
      "his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting\r\n",
      "with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid\r\n",
      "footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was\r\n",
      "running after him, calling “Wait! wait!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned round. She was at the bottom of the staircase and stopped\r\n",
      "short a step above him. A dim light came in from the yard. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "could distinguish the child’s thin but pretty little face, looking at\r\n",
      "him with a bright childish smile. She had run after him with a message\r\n",
      "which she was evidently glad to give.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me, what is your name?... and where do you live?” she said\r\n",
      "hurriedly in a breathless voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid both hands on her shoulders and looked at her with a sort of\r\n",
      "rapture. It was such a joy to him to look at her, he could not have said\r\n",
      "why.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who sent you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sister Sonia sent me,” answered the girl, smiling still more brightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew it was sister Sonia sent you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mamma sent me, too... when sister Sonia was sending me, mamma came up,\r\n",
      "too, and said ‘Run fast, Polenka.’”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you love sister Sonia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I love her more than anyone,” Polenka answered with a peculiar\r\n",
      "earnestness, and her smile became graver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And will you love me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By way of answer he saw the little girl’s face approaching him, her full\r\n",
      "lips naïvely held out to kiss him. Suddenly her arms as thin as sticks\r\n",
      "held him tightly, her head rested on his shoulder and the little girl\r\n",
      "wept softly, pressing her face against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sorry for father,” she said a moment later, raising her\r\n",
      "tear-stained face and brushing away the tears with her hands. “It’s\r\n",
      "nothing but misfortunes now,” she added suddenly with that peculiarly\r\n",
      "sedate air which children try hard to assume when they want to speak\r\n",
      "like grown-up people.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did your father love you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He loved Lida most,” she went on very seriously without a smile,\r\n",
      "exactly like grown-up people, “he loved her because she is little and\r\n",
      "because she is ill, too. And he always used to bring her presents. But\r\n",
      "he taught us to read and me grammar and scripture, too,” she added with\r\n",
      "dignity. “And mother never used to say anything, but we knew that she\r\n",
      "liked it and father knew it, too. And mother wants to teach me French,\r\n",
      "for it’s time my education began.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And do you know your prayers?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, we do! We knew them long ago. I say my prayers to myself\r\n",
      "as I am a big girl now, but Kolya and Lida say them aloud with mother.\r\n",
      "First they repeat the ‘Ave Maria’ and then another prayer: ‘Lord,\r\n",
      "forgive and bless sister Sonia,’ and then another, ‘Lord, forgive and\r\n",
      "bless our second father.’ For our elder father is dead and this is\r\n",
      "another one, but we do pray for the other as well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Polenka, my name is Rodion. Pray sometimes for me, too. ‘And Thy\r\n",
      "servant Rodion,’ nothing more.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll pray for you all the rest of my life,” the little girl declared\r\n",
      "hotly, and suddenly smiling again she rushed at him and hugged him\r\n",
      "warmly once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov told her his name and address and promised to be sure to\r\n",
      "come next day. The child went away quite enchanted with him. It was past\r\n",
      "ten when he came out into the street. In five minutes he was standing on\r\n",
      "the bridge at the spot where the woman had jumped in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Enough,” he pronounced resolutely and triumphantly. “I’ve done with\r\n",
      "fancies, imaginary terrors and phantoms! Life is real! haven’t I lived\r\n",
      "just now? My life has not yet died with that old woman! The Kingdom of\r\n",
      "Heaven to her--and now enough, madam, leave me in peace! Now for the\r\n",
      "reign of reason and light... and of will, and of strength... and now\r\n",
      "we will see! We will try our strength!” he added defiantly, as though\r\n",
      "challenging some power of darkness. “And I was ready to consent to live\r\n",
      "in a square of space!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am very weak at this moment, but... I believe my illness is all over.\r\n",
      "I knew it would be over when I went out. By the way, Potchinkov’s house\r\n",
      "is only a few steps away. I certainly must go to Razumihin even if\r\n",
      "it were not close by... let him win his bet! Let us give him some\r\n",
      "satisfaction, too--no matter! Strength, strength is what one wants, you\r\n",
      "can get nothing without it, and strength must be won by strength--that’s\r\n",
      "what they don’t know,” he added proudly and self-confidently and\r\n",
      "he walked with flagging footsteps from the bridge. Pride and\r\n",
      "self-confidence grew continually stronger in him; he was becoming\r\n",
      "a different man every moment. What was it had happened to work this\r\n",
      "revolution in him? He did not know himself; like a man catching at a\r\n",
      "straw, he suddenly felt that he, too, ‘could live, that there was still\r\n",
      "life for him, that his life had not died with the old woman.’ Perhaps he\r\n",
      "was in too great a hurry with his conclusions, but he did not think of\r\n",
      "that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I did ask her to remember ‘Thy servant Rodion’ in her prayers,” the\r\n",
      "idea struck him. “Well, that was... in case of emergency,” he added and\r\n",
      "laughed himself at his boyish sally. He was in the best of spirits.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He easily found Razumihin; the new lodger was already known at\r\n",
      "Potchinkov’s and the porter at once showed him the way. Half-way\r\n",
      "upstairs he could hear the noise and animated conversation of a big\r\n",
      "gathering of people. The door was wide open on the stairs; he could\r\n",
      "hear exclamations and discussion. Razumihin’s room was fairly large; the\r\n",
      "company consisted of fifteen people. Raskolnikov stopped in the entry,\r\n",
      "where two of the landlady’s servants were busy behind a screen with two\r\n",
      "samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up\r\n",
      "from the landlady’s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran\r\n",
      "out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a\r\n",
      "great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite\r\n",
      "drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen,” Raskolnikov hastened to say, “I’ve only just come to tell you\r\n",
      "you’ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to\r\n",
      "him. I can’t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And\r\n",
      "so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know what? I’ll see you home. If you say you’re weak yourself,\r\n",
      "you must...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And your visitors? Who is the curly-headed one who has just peeped\r\n",
      "out?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He? Goodness only knows! Some friend of uncle’s, I expect, or perhaps\r\n",
      "he has come without being invited... I’ll leave uncle with them, he\r\n",
      "is an invaluable person, pity I can’t introduce you to him now. But\r\n",
      "confound them all now! They won’t notice me, and I need a little fresh\r\n",
      "air, for you’ve come just in the nick of time--another two minutes and I\r\n",
      "should have come to blows! They are talking such a lot of wild stuff...\r\n",
      "you simply can’t imagine what men will say! Though why shouldn’t you\r\n",
      "imagine? Don’t we talk nonsense ourselves? And let them... that’s the\r\n",
      "way to learn not to!... Wait a minute, I’ll fetch Zossimov.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zossimov pounced upon Raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special\r\n",
      "interest in him; soon his face brightened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must go to bed at once,” he pronounced, examining the patient as\r\n",
      "far as he could, “and take something for the night. Will you take it? I\r\n",
      "got it ready some time ago... a powder.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Two, if you like,” answered Raskolnikov. The powder was taken at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a good thing you are taking him home,” observed Zossimov to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know what Zossimov whispered to me when we were coming out?”\r\n",
      " Razumihin blurted out, as soon as they were in the street. “I won’t tell\r\n",
      "you everything, brother, because they are such fools. Zossimov told me\r\n",
      "to talk freely to you on the way and get you to talk freely to me, and\r\n",
      "afterwards I am to tell him about it, for he’s got a notion in his head\r\n",
      "that you are... mad or close on it. Only fancy! In the first place,\r\n",
      "you’ve three times the brains he has; in the second, if you are not mad,\r\n",
      "you needn’t care a hang that he has got such a wild idea; and thirdly,\r\n",
      "that piece of beef whose specialty is surgery has gone mad on mental\r\n",

      "drunk now.... But that’s... no matter... the point is that this\r\n",
      "idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you\r\n",
      "understand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea\r\n",
      "is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that\r\n",
      "bubble’s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave\r\n",
      "Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time--that’s between ourselves,\r\n",
      "brother; please don’t let out a hint that you know of it; I’ve noticed\r\n",
      "he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna’s. But to-day, to-day\r\n",
      "it’s all cleared up. That Ilya Petrovitch is at the bottom of it! He\r\n",
      "took advantage of your fainting at the police station, but he is ashamed\r\n",

      "suddenly--put out your tongue at him: ‘There now, what do you make of\r\n",

      "he was almost beating the doctor and me this afternoon! Do you\r\n",
      "understand? The doctor himself! Even he gave way and left him, so as not\r\n",
      "to irritate him. I remained downstairs on guard, but he dressed at once\r\n",
      "and slipped off. And he will slip off again if you irritate him, at this\r\n",

      "“But I’ll go to the landlady here,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna insisted,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "This conversation took place on the landing just before the landlady’s\r\n",
      "door. Nastasya lighted them from a step below. Razumihin was in\r\n",
      "extraordinary excitement. Half an hour earlier, while he was bringing\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov home, he had indeed talked too freely, but he was aware of\r\n",
      "it himself, and his head was clear in spite of the vast quantities he\r\n",
      "had imbibed. Now he was in a state bordering on ecstasy, and all that he\r\n",
      "had drunk seemed to fly to his head with redoubled effect. He stood with\r\n",
      "the two ladies, seizing both by their hands, persuading them, and giving\r\n",
      "them reasons with astonishing plainness of speech, and at almost every\r\n",
      "word he uttered, probably to emphasise his arguments, he squeezed their\r\n",
      "hands painfully as in a vise. He stared at Avdotya Romanovna without the\r\n",
      "least regard for good manners. They sometimes pulled their hands out of\r\n",
      "his huge bony paws, but far from noticing what was the matter, he drew\r\n",
      "them all the closer to him. If they’d told him to jump head foremost\r\n",
      "from the staircase, he would have done it without thought or hesitation\r\n",
      "in their service. Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna felt that the young man\r\n",
      "was really too eccentric and pinched her hand too much, in her anxiety\r\n",
      "over her Rodya she looked on his presence as providential, and was\r\n",
      "unwilling to notice all his peculiarities. But though Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "shared her anxiety, and was not of timorous disposition, she could not\r\n",
      "see the glowing light in his eyes without wonder and almost alarm. It\r\n",
      "was only the unbounded confidence inspired by Nastasya’s account of her\r\n",
      "brother’s queer friend, which prevented her from trying to run away from\r\n",
      "him, and to persuade her mother to do the same. She realised, too,\r\n",
      "that even running away was perhaps impossible now. Ten minutes later,\r\n",
      "however, she was considerably reassured; it was characteristic of\r\n",
      "Razumihin that he showed his true nature at once, whatever mood he might\r\n",
      "be in, so that people quickly saw the sort of man they had to deal with.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can’t go to the landlady, that’s perfect nonsense!” he cried. “If\r\n",
      "you stay, though you are his mother, you’ll drive him to a frenzy, and\r\n",
      "then goodness knows what will happen! Listen, I’ll tell you what I’ll\r\n",
      "do: Nastasya will stay with him now, and I’ll conduct you both home, you\r\n",
      "can’t be in the streets alone; Petersburg is an awful place in that\r\n",
      "way.... But no matter! Then I’ll run straight back here and a quarter of\r\n",
      "an hour later, on my word of honour, I’ll bring you news how he is,\r\n",
      "whether he is asleep, and all that. Then, listen! Then I’ll run home in\r\n",
      "a twinkling--I’ve a lot of friends there, all drunk--I’ll fetch\r\n",
      "Zossimov--that’s the doctor who is looking after him, he is there, too,\r\n",
      "but he is not drunk; he is not drunk, he is never drunk! I’ll drag him\r\n",
      "to Rodya, and then to you, so that you’ll get two reports in the\r\n",
      "hour--from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that’s a\r\n",
      "very different thing from my account of him! If there’s anything wrong,\r\n",
      "I swear I’ll bring you here myself, but, if it’s all right, you go to\r\n",
      "bed. And I’ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won’t hear me,\r\n",
      "and I’ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady’s, to be at hand. Which\r\n",
      "is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the\r\n",
      "landlady is out of the question; it’s all right for me, but it’s out of\r\n",
      "the question for you: she wouldn’t take you, for she’s... for she’s a\r\n",
      "fool... She’d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you,\r\n",
      "too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an\r\n",
      "absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!...\r\n",
      "No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let us go, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna, “he will certainly do what\r\n",
      "he has promised. He has saved Rodya already, and if the doctor really\r\n",
      "will consent to spend the night here, what could be better?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see, you... you... understand me, because you are an angel!”\r\n",

      "with him with a light; I’ll come in a quarter of an hour.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though Pulcheria Alexandrovna was not perfectly convinced, she made no\r\n",
      "further resistance. Razumihin gave an arm to each and drew them down\r\n",
      "the stairs. He still made her uneasy, as though he was competent and\r\n",
      "good-natured, was he capable of carrying out his promise? He seemed in\r\n",
      "such a condition....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, I see you think I am in such a condition!” Razumihin broke in upon\r\n",
      "her thoughts, guessing them, as he strolled along the pavement with huge\r\n",
      "steps, so that the two ladies could hardly keep up with him, a fact he\r\n",
      "did not observe, however. “Nonsense! That is... I am drunk like a fool,\r\n",
      "but that’s not it; I am not drunk from wine. It’s seeing you has turned\r\n",
      "my head... But don’t mind me! Don’t take any notice: I am talking\r\n",
      "nonsense, I am not worthy of you.... I am utterly unworthy of you! The\r\n",
      "minute I’ve taken you home, I’ll pour a couple of pailfuls of water over\r\n",
      "my head in the gutter here, and then I shall be all right.... If only\r\n",
      "you knew how I love you both! Don’t laugh, and don’t be angry! You may\r\n",
      "be angry with anyone, but not with me! I am his friend, and therefore I\r\n",
      "am your friend, too, I want to be... I had a presentiment... Last year\r\n",
      "there was a moment... though it wasn’t a presentiment really, for\r\n",
      "you seem to have fallen from heaven. And I expect I shan’t sleep all\r\n",
      "night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad...\r\n",
      "that’s why he mustn’t be irritated.”\r\n",

      "“What do you say?” cried the mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did the doctor really say that?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, but it’s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a\r\n",
      "powder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been\r\n",
      "better if you had come to-morrow. It’s a good thing we went away. And in\r\n",
      "an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not\r\n",
      "drunk! And I shan’t be drunk.... And what made me get so tight? Because\r\n",
      "they got me into an argument, damn them! I’ve sworn never to argue! They\r\n",
      "talk such trash! I almost came to blows! I’ve left my uncle to preside.\r\n",
      "Would you believe, they insist on complete absence of individualism\r\n",
      "and that’s just what they relish! Not to be themselves, to be as unlike\r\n",
      "themselves as they can. That’s what they regard as the highest point of\r\n",
      "progress. If only their nonsense were their own, but as it is...”\r\n",

      "nonsense. That’s man’s one privilege over all creation. Through error\r\n",
      "you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any\r\n",
      "truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and\r\n",
      "fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can’t even make\r\n",
      "mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense,\r\n",
      "and I’ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one’s own way is better than\r\n",
      "to go right in someone else’s. In the first case you are a man, in the\r\n",
      "second you’re no better than a bird. Truth won’t escape you, but life\r\n",

      "softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she\r\n",
      "might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a\r\n",
      "little lighter than her brother’s; there was a proud light in her almost\r\n",
      "black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was\r\n",
      "pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness\r\n",
      "and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected\r\n",
      "a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful\r\n",
      "face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty\r\n",
      "expression. Her face was always more serious and thoughtful than gay;\r\n",

      "laughter suited her face! It was natural enough that a warm, open,\r\n",

      "yielding, but only to a certain point. She could give way and accept a\r\n",
      "great deal even of what was contrary to her convictions, but there was a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was nearly an hour later when they heard footsteps in the corridor\r\n",

      "relying on Razumihin’s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing\r\n",

      "suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting Razumihin in his exhilarated\r\n",
      "condition. But his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw\r\n",
      "that they were really expecting him as an oracle. He stayed just ten\r\n",
      "minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna. He spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and\r\n",
      "extreme seriousness of a young doctor at an important consultation.\r\n",
      "He did not utter a word on any other subject and did not display the\r\n",
      "slightest desire to enter into more personal relations with the two\r\n",
      "ladies. Remarking at his first entrance the dazzling beauty of Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna, he endeavoured not to notice her at all during his visit and\r\n",
      "addressed himself solely to Pulcheria Alexandrovna. All this gave him\r\n",
      "extraordinary inward satisfaction. He declared that he thought the\r\n",
      "invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. According to his\r\n",
      "observations the patient’s illness was due partly to his unfortunate\r\n",
      "material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also\r\n",
      "a moral origin, “was, so to speak, the product of several material and\r\n",
      "moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas...\r\n",
      "and so on.” Noticing stealthily that Avdotya Romanovna was following his\r\n",
      "words with close attention, Zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this\r\n",
      "theme. On Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s anxiously and timidly inquiring as\r\n",
      "to “some suspicion of insanity,” he replied with a composed and candid\r\n",
      "smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient\r\n",
      "had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomania--he, Zossimov,\r\n",
      "was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicine--but\r\n",
      "that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in\r\n",
      "delirium and... and that no doubt the presence of his family would have\r\n",
      "a favourable effect on his recovery and distract his mind, “if only all\r\n",
      "fresh shocks can be avoided,” he added significantly. Then he got up,\r\n",
      "took leave with an impressive and affable bow, while blessings, warm\r\n",
      "gratitude, and entreaties were showered upon him, and Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "spontaneously offered her hand to him. He went out exceedingly pleased\r\n",
      "with his visit and still more so with himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We’ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!” Razumihin said in conclusion,\r\n",
      "following Zossimov out. “I’ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as\r\n",
      "possible with my report.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s a fetching little girl, Avdotya Romanovna,” remarked Zossimov,\r\n",
      "almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fetching? You said fetching?” roared Razumihin and he flew at Zossimov\r\n",
      "and seized him by the throat. “If you ever dare.... Do you understand?\r\n",
      "Do you understand?” he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing\r\n",
      "him against the wall. “Do you hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me go, you drunken devil,” said Zossimov, struggling and when he\r\n",

      "Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, I am an ass,” he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, “but\r\n",
      "still... you are another.”\r\n",

      "He found himself confronted with many new and unlooked-for perplexities.\r\n",
      "He had never expected that he would ever wake up feeling like that. He\r\n",
      "remembered every detail of the previous day and he knew that a perfectly\r\n",
      "novel experience had befallen him, that he had received an impression\r\n",
      "unlike anything he had known before. At the same time he recognised\r\n",
      "clearly that the dream which had fired his imagination was hopelessly\r\n",
      "unattainable--so unattainable that he felt positively ashamed of it, and\r\n",
      "he hastened to pass to the other more practical cares and difficulties\r\n",
      "bequeathed him by that “thrice accursed yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The most awful recollection of the previous day was the way he had shown\r\n",
      "himself “base and mean,” not only because he had been drunk, but\r\n",
      "because he had taken advantage of the young girl’s position to abuse\r\n",
      "her _fiancé_ in his stupid jealousy, knowing nothing of their mutual\r\n",
      "relations and obligations and next to nothing of the man himself. And\r\n",
      "what right had he to criticise him in that hasty and unguarded manner?\r\n",
      "Who had asked for his opinion? Was it thinkable that such a creature as\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna would be marrying an unworthy man for money? So there\r\n",
      "must be something in him. The lodgings? But after all how could he know\r\n",

      "despicable it all was! And what justification was it that he was drunk?\r\n",
      "Such a stupid excuse was even more degrading! In wine is truth, and the\r\n",
      "truth had all come out, “that is, all the uncleanness of his coarse\r\n",
      "and envious heart”! And would such a dream ever be permissible to\r\n",
      "him, Razumihin? What was he beside such a girl--he, the drunken noisy\r\n",
      "braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical\r\n",
      "a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and\r\n",
      "suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had\r\n",
      "said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist\r\n",

      "frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That\r\n",
      "may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it\r\n",
      "all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but\r\n",

      "from the kitchen. I was not vouchsafed a personal interview....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At nine o’clock precisely Razumihin reached the lodgings at Bakaleyev’s\r\n",
      "house. Both ladies were waiting for him with nervous impatience. They\r\n",
      "had risen at seven o’clock or earlier. He entered looking as black as\r\n",
      "night, bowed awkwardly and was at once furious with himself for it. He\r\n",
      "had reckoned without his host: Pulcheria Alexandrovna fairly rushed at\r\n",
      "him, seized him by both hands and was almost kissing them. He glanced\r\n",
      "timidly at Avdotya Romanovna, but her proud countenance wore at that\r\n",
      "moment an expression of such gratitude and friendliness, such\r\n",
      "complete and unlooked-for respect (in place of the sneering looks and\r\n",
      "ill-disguised contempt he had expected), that it threw him into greater\r\n",
      "confusion than if he had been met with abuse. Fortunately there was a\r\n",
      "subject for conversation, and he made haste to snatch at it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Hearing that everything was going well and that Rodya had not yet waked,\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna declared that she was glad to hear it, because\r\n",
      "“she had something which it was very, very necessary to talk over\r\n",
      "beforehand.” Then followed an inquiry about breakfast and an invitation\r\n",
      "to have it with them; they had waited to have it with him. Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna rang the bell: it was answered by a ragged dirty waiter, and\r\n",
      "they asked him to bring tea which was served at last, but in such\r\n",
      "a dirty and disorderly way that the ladies were ashamed. Razumihin\r\n",
      "vigorously attacked the lodgings, but, remembering Luzhin, stopped\r\n",
      "in embarrassment and was greatly relieved by Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\r\n",
      "questions, which showered in a continual stream upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He talked for three quarters of an hour, being constantly interrupted\r\n",
      "by their questions, and succeeded in describing to them all the\r\n",
      "most important facts he knew of the last year of Raskolnikov’s life,\r\n",
      "concluding with a circumstantial account of his illness. He omitted,\r\n",
      "however, many things, which were better omitted, including the scene at\r\n",
      "the police station with all its consequences. They listened eagerly\r\n",
      "to his story, and, when he thought he had finished and satisfied his\r\n",
      "listeners, he found that they considered he had hardly begun.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me, tell me! What do you think...? Excuse me, I still don’t know\r\n",
      "your name!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna put in hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dmitri Prokofitch.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should like very, very much to know, Dmitri Prokofitch... how he\r\n",
      "looks... on things in general now, that is, how can I explain, what are\r\n",
      "his likes and dislikes? Is he always so irritable? Tell me, if you can,\r\n",
      "what are his hopes and, so to say, his dreams? Under what influences is\r\n",
      "he now? In a word, I should like...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, mother, how can he answer all that at once?” observed Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens, I had not expected to find him in the least like this,\r\n",
      "Dmitri Prokofitch!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Naturally,” answered Razumihin. “I have no mother, but my uncle comes\r\n",
      "every year and almost every time he can scarcely recognise me, even in\r\n",
      "appearance, though he is a clever man; and your three years’ separation\r\n",
      "means a great deal. What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for\r\n",
      "a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of\r\n",
      "late--and perhaps for a long time before--he has been suspicious and\r\n",
      "fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like\r\n",
      "showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his\r\n",
      "heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply\r\n",
      "cold and inhumanly callous; it’s as though he were alternating between\r\n",
      "two characters. Sometimes he is fearfully reserved! He says he is\r\n",
      "so busy that everything is a hindrance, and yet he lies in bed doing\r\n",
      "nothing. He doesn’t jeer at things, not because he hasn’t the wit, but\r\n",
      "as though he hadn’t time to waste on such trifles. He never listens\r\n",
      "to what is said to him. He is never interested in what interests other\r\n",
      "people at any given moment. He thinks very highly of himself and perhaps\r\n",
      "he is right. Well, what more? I think your arrival will have a most\r\n",
      "beneficial influence upon him.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God grant it may,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, distressed by\r\n",
      "Razumihin’s account of her Rodya.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Razumihin ventured to look more boldly at Avdotya Romanovna at last.\r\n",
      "He glanced at her often while he was talking, but only for a moment and\r\n",
      "looked away again at once. Avdotya Romanovna sat at the table, listening\r\n",
      "attentively, then got up again and began walking to and fro with her\r\n",
      "arms folded and her lips compressed, occasionally putting in a question,\r\n",
      "without stopping her walk. She had the same habit of not listening to\r\n",
      "what was said. She was wearing a dress of thin dark stuff and she had a\r\n",
      "white transparent scarf round her neck. Razumihin soon detected signs of\r\n",
      "extreme poverty in their belongings. Had Avdotya Romanovna been dressed\r\n",
      "like a queen, he felt that he would not be afraid of her, but perhaps\r\n",
      "just because she was poorly dressed and that he noticed all the misery\r\n",
      "of her surroundings, his heart was filled with dread and he began to be\r\n",
      "afraid of every word he uttered, every gesture he made, which was very\r\n",
      "trying for a man who already felt diffident.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ve told us a great deal that is interesting about my brother’s\r\n",
      "character... and have told it impartially. I am glad. I thought that you\r\n",
      "were too uncritically devoted to him,” observed Avdotya Romanovna with\r\n",
      "a smile. “I think you are right that he needs a woman’s care,” she added\r\n",
      "thoughtfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I didn’t say so; but I daresay you are right, only...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He loves no one and perhaps he never will,” Razumihin declared\r\n",
      "decisively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You mean he is not capable of love?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Avdotya Romanovna, you are awfully like your brother, in\r\n",
      "everything, indeed!” he blurted out suddenly to his own surprise, but\r\n",
      "remembering at once what he had just before said of her brother,\r\n",
      "he turned as red as a crab and was overcome with confusion. Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna couldn’t help laughing when she looked at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You may both be mistaken about Rodya,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna remarked,\r\n",
      "slightly piqued. “I am not talking of our present difficulty, Dounia.\r\n",
      "What Pyotr Petrovitch writes in this letter and what you and I have\r\n",
      "supposed may be mistaken, but you can’t imagine, Dmitri Prokofitch, how\r\n",
      "moody and, so to say, capricious he is. I never could depend on what\r\n",
      "he would do when he was only fifteen. And I am sure that he might\r\n",
      "do something now that nobody else would think of doing... Well, for\r\n",
      "instance, do you know how a year and a half ago he astounded me and gave\r\n",
      "me a shock that nearly killed me, when he had the idea of marrying that\r\n",
      "girl--what was her name--his landlady’s daughter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you hear about that affair?” asked Avdotya Romanovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you suppose----” Pulcheria Alexandrovna continued warmly. “Do you\r\n",
      "suppose that my tears, my entreaties, my illness, my possible death from\r\n",
      "grief, our poverty would have made him pause? No, he would calmly have\r\n",
      "disregarded all obstacles. And yet it isn’t that he doesn’t love us!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has never spoken a word of that affair to me,” Razumihin answered\r\n",
      "cautiously. “But I did hear something from Praskovya Pavlovna herself,\r\n",
      "though she is by no means a gossip. And what I heard certainly was\r\n",
      "rather strange.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what did you hear?” both the ladies asked at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, nothing very special. I only learned that the marriage, which\r\n",
      "only failed to take place through the girl’s death, was not at all to\r\n",
      "Praskovya Pavlovna’s liking. They say, too, the girl was not at all\r\n",
      "pretty, in fact I am told positively ugly... and such an invalid... and\r\n",
      "queer. But she seems to have had some good qualities. She must have\r\n",
      "had some good qualities or it’s quite inexplicable.... She had no money\r\n",
      "either and he wouldn’t have considered her money.... But it’s always\r\n",
      "difficult to judge in such matters.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am sure she was a good girl,” Avdotya Romanovna observed briefly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“God forgive me, I simply rejoiced at her death. Though I don’t know\r\n",
      "which of them would have caused most misery to the other--he to her\r\n",
      "or she to him,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna concluded. Then she began\r\n",
      "tentatively questioning him about the scene on the previous day with\r\n",
      "Luzhin, hesitating and continually glancing at Dounia, obviously to\r\n",
      "the latter’s annoyance. This incident more than all the rest evidently\r\n",
      "caused her uneasiness, even consternation. Razumihin described it in\r\n",
      "detail again, but this time he added his own conclusions: he openly\r\n",
      "blamed Raskolnikov for intentionally insulting Pyotr Petrovitch, not\r\n",
      "seeking to excuse him on the score of his illness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He had planned it before his illness,” he added.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I think so, too,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna agreed with a dejected air.\r\n",
      "But she was very much surprised at hearing Razumihin express himself\r\n",
      "so carefully and even with a certain respect about Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna, too, was struck by it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So this is your opinion of Pyotr Petrovitch?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna\r\n",
      "could not resist asking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can have no other opinion of your daughter’s future husband,”\r\n",
      " Razumihin answered firmly and with warmth, “and I don’t say it simply\r\n",
      "from vulgar politeness, but because... simply because Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "has of her own free will deigned to accept this man. If I spoke so\r\n",
      "rudely of him last night, it was because I was disgustingly drunk and...\r\n",
      "mad besides; yes, mad, crazy, I lost my head completely... and this\r\n",
      "morning I am ashamed of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He crimsoned and ceased speaking. Avdotya Romanovna flushed, but did not\r\n",
      "break the silence. She had not uttered a word from the moment they began\r\n",
      "to speak of Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without her support Pulcheria Alexandrovna obviously did not know what\r\n",
      "to do. At last, faltering and continually glancing at her daughter, she\r\n",
      "confessed that she was exceedingly worried by one circumstance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see, Dmitri Prokofitch,” she began. “I’ll be perfectly open with\r\n",
      "Dmitri Prokofitch, Dounia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, mother,” said Avdotya Romanovna emphatically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This is what it is,” she began in haste, as though the permission to\r\n",
      "speak of her trouble lifted a weight off her mind. “Very early this\r\n",
      "morning we got a note from Pyotr Petrovitch in reply to our letter\r\n",
      "announcing our arrival. He promised to meet us at the station, you\r\n",
      "know; instead of that he sent a servant to bring us the address of these\r\n",
      "lodgings and to show us the way; and he sent a message that he would\r\n",
      "be here himself this morning. But this morning this note came from him.\r\n",
      "You’d better read it yourself; there is one point in it which worries me\r\n",
      "very much... you will soon see what that is, and... tell me your candid\r\n",
      "opinion, Dmitri Prokofitch! You know Rodya’s character better than\r\n",
      "anyone and no one can advise us better than you can. Dounia, I must tell\r\n",
      "you, made her decision at once, but I still don’t feel sure how to act\r\n",
      "and I... I’ve been waiting for your opinion.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin opened the note which was dated the previous evening and read\r\n",
      "as follows:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dear Madam, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, I have the honour to inform you\r\n",
      "that owing to unforeseen obstacles I was rendered unable to meet you at\r\n",
      "the railway station; I sent a very competent person with the same object\r\n",
      "in view. I likewise shall be deprived of the honour of an interview with\r\n",
      "you to-morrow morning by business in the Senate that does not admit of\r\n",
      "delay, and also that I may not intrude on your family circle while you\r\n",
      "are meeting your son, and Avdotya Romanovna her brother. I shall have\r\n",
      "the honour of visiting you and paying you my respects at your lodgings\r\n",
      "not later than to-morrow evening at eight o’clock precisely, and\r\n",
      "herewith I venture to present my earnest and, I may add, imperative\r\n",
      "request that Rodion Romanovitch may not be present at our interview--as\r\n",
      "he offered me a gross and unprecedented affront on the occasion of my\r\n",
      "visit to him in his illness yesterday, and, moreover, since I desire\r\n",
      "from you personally an indispensable and circumstantial explanation\r\n",
      "upon a certain point, in regard to which I wish to learn your own\r\n",
      "interpretation. I have the honour to inform you, in anticipation,\r\n",
      "that if, in spite of my request, I meet Rodion Romanovitch, I shall be\r\n",
      "compelled to withdraw immediately and then you have only yourself to\r\n",
      "blame. I write on the assumption that Rodion Romanovitch who appeared so\r\n",
      "ill at my visit, suddenly recovered two hours later and so, being able\r\n",
      "to leave the house, may visit you also. I was confirmed in that belief\r\n",
      "by the testimony of my own eyes in the lodging of a drunken man who\r\n",
      "was run over and has since died, to whose daughter, a young woman of\r\n",
      "notorious behaviour, he gave twenty-five roubles on the pretext of the\r\n",
      "funeral, which gravely surprised me knowing what pains you were at to\r\n",
      "raise that sum. Herewith expressing my special respect to your estimable\r\n",
      "daughter, Avdotya Romanovna, I beg you to accept the respectful homage\r\n",
      "of\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your humble servant,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“P. LUZHIN.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What am I to do now, Dmitri Prokofitch?” began Pulcheria Alexandrovna,\r\n",
      "almost weeping. “How can I ask Rodya not to come? Yesterday he insisted\r\n",
      "so earnestly on our refusing Pyotr Petrovitch and now we are ordered not\r\n",
      "to receive Rodya! He will come on purpose if he knows, and... what will\r\n",
      "happen then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Act on Avdotya Romanovna’s decision,” Razumihin answered calmly at\r\n",
      "once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, dear me! She says... goodness knows what she says, she doesn’t\r\n",
      "explain her object! She says that it would be best, at least, not that\r\n",
      "it would be best, but that it’s absolutely necessary that Rodya should\r\n",
      "make a point of being here at eight o’clock and that they must meet....\r\n",
      "I didn’t want even to show him the letter, but to prevent him\r\n",
      "from coming by some stratagem with your help... because he is so\r\n",
      "irritable.... Besides I don’t understand about that drunkard who died\r\n",
      "and that daughter, and how he could have given the daughter all the\r\n",
      "money... which...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "only knew what he was up to in a restaurant yesterday, though there\r\n",
      "was sense in it too.... Hm! He did say something, as we were going home\r\n",
      "yesterday evening, about a dead man and a girl, but I didn’t understand\r\n",
      "a word.... But last night, I myself...”\r\n",

      "a splendid gold enamelled watch which hung round her neck on a thin\r\n",
      "Venetian chain, and looked entirely out of keeping with the rest of her\r\n",
      "dress. “A present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin.\r\n",

      "gave the two ladies an air of special dignity, which is always found in\r\n",
      "people who know how to wear poor clothes. Razumihin looked reverently\r\n",
      "at Dounia and felt proud of escorting her. “The queen who mended her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“He is well, quite well!” Zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place\r\n",
      "as before, on the sofa. Raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner,\r\n",
      "fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for\r\n",
      "some time past. The room was immediately crowded, yet Nastasya managed\r\n",
      "to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the\r\n",
      "day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. He looked like\r\n",
      "a wounded man or one who has undergone some terrible physical suffering.\r\n",
      "His brows were knitted, his lips compressed, his eyes feverish. He spoke\r\n",
      "little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a\r\n",
      "restlessness in his movements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete\r\n",
      "the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. The\r\n",
      "pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister\r\n",
      "entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in\r\n",
      "place of its listless dejection. The light soon died away, but the look\r\n",
      "of suffering remained, and Zossimov, watching and studying his patient\r\n",
      "with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed\r\n",
      "in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of\r\n",
      "bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable\r\n",
      "torture. He saw later that almost every word of the following\r\n",
      "conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. But\r\n",
      "at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself\r\n",
      "and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day had, like a\r\n",
      "monomaniac, fallen into a frenzy at the slightest word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I see myself now that I am almost well,” said Raskolnikov,\r\n",
      "giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna radiant at once. “And I don’t say this _as I did\r\n",
      "yesterday_,” he said, addressing Razumihin, with a friendly pressure of\r\n",
      "his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, I am quite surprised at him to-day,” began Zossimov, much\r\n",
      "delighted at the ladies’ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping\r\n",
      "up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. “In another three or\r\n",
      "four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is,\r\n",
      "as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. This has been\r\n",
      "coming on for a long while.... eh? Confess, now, that it has been\r\n",
      "perhaps your own fault?” he added, with a tentative smile, as though\r\n",
      "still afraid of irritating him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is very possible,” answered Raskolnikov coldly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should say, too,” continued Zossimov with zest, “that your complete\r\n",
      "recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you,\r\n",
      "I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the\r\n",
      "elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your\r\n",
      "morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go\r\n",
      "from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don’t know, but they must\r\n",
      "be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed\r\n",
      "yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement\r\n",
      "coincides with your leaving the university. You must not be left without\r\n",
      "occupation, and so, work and a definite aim set before you might, I\r\n",
      "fancy, be very beneficial.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes; you are perfectly right.... I will make haste and return to\r\n",
      "the university: and then everything will go smoothly....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before\r\n",
      "the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his\r\n",
      "patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. This lasted\r\n",
      "an instant, however. Pulcheria Alexandrovna began at once thanking\r\n",
      "Zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! he saw you last night?” Raskolnikov asked, as though startled.\r\n",
      "“Then you have not slept either after your journey.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, Rodya, that was only till two o’clock. Dounia and I never go to\r\n",
      "bed before two at home.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know how to thank him either,” Raskolnikov went on,\r\n",
      "suddenly frowning and looking down. “Setting aside the question of\r\n",
      "payment--forgive me for referring to it (he turned to Zossimov)--I\r\n",
      "really don’t know what I have done to deserve such special attention\r\n",
      "from you! I simply don’t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon\r\n",
      "me, indeed, because I don’t understand it. I tell you so candidly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be irritated.” Zossimov forced himself to laugh. “Assume that you\r\n",
      "are my first patient--well--we fellows just beginning to practise love\r\n",
      "our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in\r\n",
      "love with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say nothing about him,” added Raskolnikov, pointing to Razumihin,\r\n",
      "“though he has had nothing from me either but insult and trouble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What nonsense he is talking! Why, you are in a sentimental mood to-day,\r\n",
      "are you?” shouted Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "If he had had more penetration he would have seen that there was no\r\n",
      "trace of sentimentality in him, but something indeed quite the opposite.\r\n",
      "But Avdotya Romanovna noticed it. She was intently and uneasily watching\r\n",
      "her brother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As for you, mother, I don’t dare to speak,” he went on, as though\r\n",
      "repeating a lesson learned by heart. “It is only to-day that I have\r\n",
      "been able to realise a little how distressed you must have been here\r\n",
      "yesterday, waiting for me to come back.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he had said this, he suddenly held out his hand to his sister,\r\n",
      "smiling without a word. But in this smile there was a flash of real\r\n",
      "unfeigned feeling. Dounia caught it at once, and warmly pressed his\r\n",
      "hand, overjoyed and thankful. It was the first time he had addressed her\r\n",
      "since their dispute the previous day. The mother’s face lighted up\r\n",
      "with ecstatic happiness at the sight of this conclusive unspoken\r\n",
      "reconciliation. “Yes, that is what I love him for,” Razumihin,\r\n",
      "exaggerating it all, muttered to himself, with a vigorous turn in his\r\n",
      "chair. “He has these movements.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And how well he does it all,” the mother was thinking to herself. “What\r\n",
      "generous impulses he has, and how simply, how delicately he put an end\r\n",
      "to all the misunderstanding with his sister--simply by holding out his\r\n",
      "hand at the right minute and looking at her like that.... And what\r\n",
      "fine eyes he has, and how fine his whole face is!... He is even better\r\n",
      "looking than Dounia.... But, good heavens, what a suit--how terribly\r\n",
      "he’s dressed!... Vasya, the messenger boy in Afanasy Ivanitch’s shop, is\r\n",
      "better dressed! I could rush at him and hug him... weep over him--but\r\n",
      "I am afraid.... Oh, dear, he’s so strange! He’s talking kindly, but I’m\r\n",
      "afraid! Why, what am I afraid of?...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Rodya, you wouldn’t believe,” she began suddenly, in haste to\r\n",
      "answer his words to her, “how unhappy Dounia and I were yesterday! Now\r\n",
      "that it’s all over and done with and we are quite happy again--I can\r\n",
      "tell you. Fancy, we ran here almost straight from the train to embrace\r\n",
      "you and that woman--ah, here she is! Good morning, Nastasya!... She told\r\n",
      "us at once that you were lying in a high fever and had just run away\r\n",
      "from the doctor in delirium, and they were looking for you in the\r\n",
      "streets. You can’t imagine how we felt! I couldn’t help thinking of the\r\n",
      "tragic end of Lieutenant Potanchikov, a friend of your father’s--you\r\n",
      "can’t remember him, Rodya--who ran out in the same way in a high fever\r\n",
      "and fell into the well in the court-yard and they couldn’t pull him out\r\n",
      "till next day. Of course, we exaggerated things. We were on the point of\r\n",
      "rushing to find Pyotr Petrovitch to ask him to help.... Because we were\r\n",
      "alone, utterly alone,” she said plaintively and stopped short,\r\n",
      "suddenly, recollecting it was still somewhat dangerous to speak of Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch, although “we are quite happy again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes.... Of course it’s very annoying....” Raskolnikov muttered in\r\n",
      "reply, but with such a preoccupied and inattentive air that Dounia gazed\r\n",
      "at him in perplexity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What else was it I wanted to say?” He went on trying to recollect. “Oh,\r\n",
      "yes; mother, and you too, Dounia, please don’t think that I didn’t mean\r\n",
      "to come and see you to-day and was waiting for you to come first.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you saying, Rodya?” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. She, too,\r\n",
      "was surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is he answering us as a duty?” Dounia wondered. “Is he being reconciled\r\n",
      "and asking forgiveness as though he were performing a rite or repeating\r\n",
      "a lesson?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve only just waked up, and wanted to go to you, but was delayed owing\r\n",
      "to my clothes; I forgot yesterday to ask her... Nastasya... to wash out\r\n",
      "the blood... I’ve only just dressed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Blood! What blood?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna asked in alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, nothing--don’t be uneasy. It was when I was wandering about\r\n",
      "yesterday, rather delirious, I chanced upon a man who had been run\r\n",
      "over... a clerk...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Delirious? But you remember everything!” Razumihin interrupted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s true,” Raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. “I\r\n",
      "remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yet--why I did\r\n",
      "that and went there and said that, I can’t clearly explain now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A familiar phenomenon,” interposed Zossimov, “actions are sometimes\r\n",
      "performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the\r\n",
      "actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressions--it’s\r\n",
      "like a dream.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps it’s a good thing really that he should think me almost a\r\n",
      "madman,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, people in perfect health act in the same way too,” observed\r\n",
      "Dounia, looking uneasily at Zossimov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is some truth in your observation,” the latter replied. “In that\r\n",
      "sense we are certainly all not infrequently like madmen, but with the\r\n",
      "slight difference that the deranged are somewhat madder, for we\r\n",
      "must draw a line. A normal man, it is true, hardly exists. Among\r\n",
      "dozens--perhaps hundreds of thousands--hardly one is to be met with.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the word “madman,” carelessly dropped by Zossimov in his chatter on\r\n",
      "his favourite subject, everyone frowned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a\r\n",
      "strange smile on his pale lips. He was still meditating on something.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, what about the man who was run over? I interrupted you!”\r\n",
      " Razumihin cried hastily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What?” Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. “Oh... I got spattered with\r\n",
      "blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an\r\n",
      "unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave\r\n",
      "away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She’s\r\n",
      "a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children,\r\n",
      "starving... nothing in the house... there’s a daughter, too... perhaps\r\n",
      "you’d have given it yourself if you’d seen them. But I had no right to\r\n",
      "do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself.\r\n",
      "To help others one must have the right to do it, or else _Crevez,\r\n",
      "chiens, si vous n’êtes pas contents_.” He laughed, “That’s right, isn’t\r\n",
      "it, Dounia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it’s not,” answered Dounia firmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bah! you, too, have ideals,” he muttered, looking at her almost with\r\n",
      "hatred, and smiling sarcastically. “I ought to have considered that....\r\n",
      "Well, that’s praiseworthy, and it’s better for you... and if you reach a\r\n",
      "line you won’t overstep, you will be unhappy... and if you overstep it,\r\n",
      "maybe you will be still unhappier.... But all that’s nonsense,” he added\r\n",
      "irritably, vexed at being carried away. “I only meant to say that I beg\r\n",
      "your forgiveness, mother,” he concluded, shortly and abruptly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s enough, Rodya, I am sure that everything you do is very good,”\r\n",
      " said his mother, delighted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be too sure,” he answered, twisting his mouth into a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A silence followed. There was a certain constraint in all this\r\n",
      "conversation, and in the silence, and in the reconciliation, and in the\r\n",
      "forgiveness, and all were feeling it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is as though they were afraid of me,” Raskolnikov was thinking\r\n",
      "to himself, looking askance at his mother and sister. Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna was indeed growing more timid the longer she kept silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yet in their absence I seemed to love them so much,” flashed through\r\n",
      "his mind.\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "“A-a-h! Yes, I remember.... So she’s dead! Oh, really?” he roused\r\n",
      "himself suddenly, as if waking up. “What did she die of?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only imagine, quite suddenly,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna answered\r\n",
      "hurriedly, encouraged by his curiosity. “On the very day I was sending\r\n",
      "you that letter! Would you believe it, that awful man seems to have been\r\n",
      "the cause of her death. They say he beat her dreadfully.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, were they on such bad terms?” he asked, addressing his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not at all. Quite the contrary indeed. With her, he was always very\r\n",
      "patient, considerate even. In fact, all those seven years of their\r\n",
      "married life he gave way to her, too much so indeed, in many cases. All\r\n",
      "of a sudden he seems to have lost patience.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then he could not have been so awful if he controlled himself for seven\r\n",
      "years? You seem to be defending him, Dounia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, he’s an awful man! I can imagine nothing more awful!” Dounia\r\n",
      "answered, almost with a shudder, knitting her brows, and sinking into\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That had happened in the morning,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on\r\n",
      "hurriedly. “And directly afterwards she ordered the horses to be\r\n",
      "harnessed to drive to the town immediately after dinner. She always used\r\n",
      "to drive to the town in such cases. She ate a very good dinner, I am\r\n",
      "told....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“After the beating?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That was always her... habit; and immediately after dinner, so as not\r\n",
      "to be late in starting, she went to the bath-house.... You see, she was\r\n",
      "undergoing some treatment with baths. They have a cold spring there, and\r\n",
      "she used to bathe in it regularly every day, and no sooner had she got\r\n",
      "into the water when she suddenly had a stroke!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I should think so,” said Zossimov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And did he beat her badly?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What does that matter!” put in Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“H’m! But I don’t know why you want to tell us such gossip, mother,”\r\n",
      " said Raskolnikov irritably, as it were in spite of himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, my dear, I don’t know what to talk about,” broke from Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, are you all afraid of me?” he asked, with a constrained smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s certainly true,” said Dounia, looking directly and sternly at\r\n",
      "her brother. “Mother was crossing herself with terror as she came up the\r\n",
      "stairs.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His face worked, as though in convulsion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, what are you saying, Dounia! Don’t be angry, please, Rodya....\r\n",
      "Why did you say that, Dounia?” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began,\r\n",
      "overwhelmed--“You see, coming here, I was dreaming all the way, in the\r\n",
      "train, how we should meet, how we should talk over everything\r\n",
      "together.... And I was so happy, I did not notice the journey! But what\r\n",
      "am I saying? I am happy now.... You should not, Dounia.... I am happy\r\n",
      "now--simply in seeing you, Rodya....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, mother,” he muttered in confusion, not looking at her, but\r\n",
      "pressing her hand. “We shall have time to speak freely of everything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he said this, he was suddenly overwhelmed with confusion and turned\r\n",
      "pale. Again that awful sensation he had known of late passed with deadly\r\n",
      "chill over his soul. Again it became suddenly plain and perceptible to\r\n",
      "him that he had just told a fearful lie--that he would never now be\r\n",
      "able to speak freely of everything--that he would never again be able to\r\n",
      "_speak_ of anything to anyone. The anguish of this thought was such that\r\n",
      "for a moment he almost forgot himself. He got up from his seat, and not\r\n",
      "looking at anyone walked towards the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you about?” cried Razumihin, clutching him by the arm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat down again, and began looking about him, in silence. They were\r\n",
      "all looking at him in perplexity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what are you all so dull for?” he shouted, suddenly and quite\r\n",
      "unexpectedly. “Do say something! What’s the use of sitting like this?\r\n",
      "Come, do speak. Let us talk.... We meet together and sit in silence....\r\n",
      "Come, anything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank God; I was afraid the same thing as yesterday was beginning\r\n",
      "again,” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is the matter, Rodya?” asked Avdotya Romanovna, distrustfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, nothing! I remembered something,” he answered, and suddenly\r\n",
      "laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, if you remembered something; that’s all right!... I was beginning\r\n",
      "to think...” muttered Zossimov, getting up from the sofa. “It is time\r\n",
      "for me to be off. I will look in again perhaps... if I can...” He made\r\n",
      "his bows, and went out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What an excellent man!” observed Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he\r\n",
      "had not shown till then. “I can’t remember where I met him before my\r\n",
      "illness.... I believe I have met him somewhere----... And this is a good\r\n",
      "man, too,” he nodded at Razumihin. “Do you like him, Dounia?” he asked\r\n",
      "her; and suddenly, for some unknown reason, laughed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Very much,” answered Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Foo!--what a pig you are!” Razumihin protested, blushing in terrible\r\n",
      "confusion, and he got up from his chair. Pulcheria Alexandrovna smiled\r\n",
      "faintly, but Raskolnikov laughed aloud.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are you off to?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must go.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You need not at all. Stay. Zossimov has gone, so you must. Don’t go.\r\n",
      "What’s the time? Is it twelve o’clock? What a pretty watch you have got,\r\n",
      "Dounia. But why are you all silent again? I do all the talking.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was a present from Marfa Petrovna,” answered Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And a very expensive one!” added Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ah! What a big one! Hardly like a lady’s.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I like that sort,” said Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So it is not a present from her _fiancé_,” thought Razumihin, and was\r\n",
      "unreasonably delighted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought it was Luzhin’s present,” observed Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, he has not made Dounia any presents yet.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A-ah! And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get\r\n",
      "married?” he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted\r\n",
      "by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes, my dear.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“H’m, yes. What shall I tell you? I don’t remember much indeed. She was\r\n",
      "such a sickly girl,” he went on, growing dreamy and looking down again.\r\n",
      "“Quite an invalid. She was fond of giving alms to the poor, and was\r\n",
      "always dreaming of a nunnery, and once she burst into tears when she\r\n",
      "began talking to me about it. Yes, yes, I remember. I remember very\r\n",
      "well. She was an ugly little thing. I really don’t know what drew me\r\n",
      "to her then--I think it was because she was always ill. If she had been\r\n",
      "lame or hunchback, I believe I should have liked her better still,” he\r\n",
      "smiled dreamily. “Yes, it was a sort of spring delirium.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it was not only spring delirium,” said Dounia, with warm feeling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fixed a strained intent look on his sister, but did not hear or did\r\n",
      "not understand her words. Then, completely lost in thought, he got up,\r\n",
      "went up to his mother, kissed her, went back to his place and sat down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You love her even now?” said Pulcheria Alexandrovna, touched.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Her? Now? Oh, yes.... You ask about her? No... that’s all now, as\r\n",
      "it were, in another world... and so long ago. And indeed everything\r\n",
      "happening here seems somehow far away.” He looked attentively at them.\r\n",
      "“You, now... I seem to be looking at you from a thousand miles away...\r\n",
      "but, goodness knows why we are talking of that! And what’s the use of\r\n",
      "asking about it?” he added with annoyance, and biting his nails, fell\r\n",
      "into dreamy silence again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a wretched lodging you have, Rodya! It’s like a tomb,” said\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna, suddenly breaking the oppressive silence. “I\r\n",
      "am sure it’s quite half through your lodging you have become so\r\n",
      "melancholy.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My lodging,” he answered, listlessly. “Yes, the lodging had a great\r\n",
      "deal to do with it.... I thought that, too.... If only you knew, though,\r\n",
      "what a strange thing you said just now, mother,” he said, laughing\r\n",
      "strangely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little more, and their companionship, this mother and this sister,\r\n",
      "with him after three years’ absence, this intimate tone of conversation,\r\n",
      "in face of the utter impossibility of really speaking about anything,\r\n",
      "would have been beyond his power of endurance. But there was one urgent\r\n",
      "matter which must be settled one way or the other that day--so he had\r\n",
      "decided when he woke. Now he was glad to remember it, as a means of\r\n",
      "escape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen, Dounia,” he began, gravely and drily, “of course I beg your\r\n",
      "pardon for yesterday, but I consider it my duty to tell you again that\r\n",
      "I do not withdraw from my chief point. It is me or Luzhin. If I am a\r\n",
      "scoundrel, you must not be. One is enough. If you marry Luzhin, I cease\r\n",
      "at once to look on you as a sister.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rodya, Rodya! It is the same as yesterday again,” Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna cried, mournfully. “And why do you call yourself a\r\n",
      "scoundrel? I can’t bear it. You said the same yesterday.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Brother,” Dounia answered firmly and with the same dryness. “In all\r\n",
      "this there is a mistake on your part. I thought it over at night,\r\n",
      "and found out the mistake. It is all because you seem to fancy I am\r\n",
      "sacrificing myself to someone and for someone. That is not the case at\r\n",
      "all. I am simply marrying for my own sake, because things are hard for\r\n",
      "me. Though, of course, I shall be glad if I succeed in being useful to\r\n",
      "my family. But that is not the chief motive for my decision....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is lying,” he thought to himself, biting his nails vindictively.\r\n",
      "“Proud creature! She won’t admit she wants to do it out of charity! Too\r\n",
      "haughty! Oh, base characters! They even love as though they hate.... Oh,\r\n",
      "how I... hate them all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“In fact,” continued Dounia, “I am marrying Pyotr Petrovitch because of\r\n",
      "two evils I choose the less. I intend to do honestly all he expects of\r\n",
      "me, so I am not deceiving him.... Why did you smile just now?” She, too,\r\n",
      "flushed, and there was a gleam of anger in her eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“All?” he asked, with a malignant grin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Within certain limits. Both the manner and form of Pyotr Petrovitch’s\r\n",
      "courtship showed me at once what he wanted. He may, of course, think too\r\n",
      "well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing\r\n",
      "again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are\r\n",
      "intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your\r\n",
      "own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked\r\n",
      "with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you\r\n",
      "are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is not true. I am not lying,” cried Dounia, losing her composure.\r\n",
      "“I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me\r\n",
      "and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly\r\n",
      "convinced that I can respect him. Fortunately, I can have convincing\r\n",
      "proof of it this very day... and such a marriage is not a vileness, as\r\n",
      "you say! And even if you were right, if I really had determined on a\r\n",
      "vile action, is it not merciless on your part to speak to me like that?\r\n",
      "Why do you demand of me a heroism that perhaps you have not either? It\r\n",
      "is despotism; it is tyranny. If I ruin anyone, it is only myself.... I\r\n",
      "am not committing a murder. Why do you look at me like that? Why are you\r\n",
      "so pale? Rodya, darling, what’s the matter?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! You have made him faint,” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, nonsense! It’s nothing. A little giddiness--not fainting. You\r\n",
      "have fainting on the brain. H’m, yes, what was I saying? Oh, yes. In\r\n",
      "what way will you get convincing proof to-day that you can respect him,\r\n",
      "and that he... esteems you, as you said. I think you said to-day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mother, show Rodya Pyotr Petrovitch’s letter,” said Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With trembling hands, Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave him the letter. He\r\n",
      "took it with great interest, but, before opening it, he suddenly looked\r\n",
      "with a sort of wonder at Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is strange,” he said, slowly, as though struck by a new idea. “What\r\n",
      "am I making such a fuss for? What is it all about? Marry whom you like!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said this as though to himself, but said it aloud, and looked for\r\n",
      "some time at his sister, as though puzzled. He opened the letter at\r\n",
      "last, still with the same look of strange wonder on his face. Then,\r\n",
      "slowly and attentively, he began reading, and read it through twice.\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna showed marked anxiety, and all indeed expected\r\n",
      "something particular.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What surprises me,” he began, after a short pause, handing the letter\r\n",
      "to his mother, but not addressing anyone in particular, “is that he is a\r\n",
      "business man, a lawyer, and his conversation is pretentious indeed, and\r\n",
      "yet he writes such an uneducated letter.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They all started. They had expected something quite different.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But they all write like that, you know,” Razumihin observed, abruptly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you read it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We showed him, Rodya. We... consulted him just now,” Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna began, embarrassed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just the jargon of the courts,” Razumihin put in. “Legal\r\n",
      "documents are written like that to this day.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Legal? Yes, it’s just legal--business language--not so very uneducated,\r\n",
      "and not quite educated--business language!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pyotr Petrovitch makes no secret of the fact that he had a cheap\r\n",
      "education, he is proud indeed of having made his own way,” Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna observed, somewhat offended by her brother’s tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, if he’s proud of it, he has reason, I don’t deny it. You seem to\r\n",
      "be offended, sister, at my making only such a frivolous criticism on the\r\n",
      "letter, and to think that I speak of such trifling matters on purpose to\r\n",
      "annoy you. It is quite the contrary, an observation apropos of the style\r\n",
      "occurred to me that is by no means irrelevant as things stand. There\r\n",
      "is one expression, ‘blame yourselves’ put in very significantly and\r\n",
      "plainly, and there is besides a threat that he will go away at once if I\r\n",
      "am present. That threat to go away is equivalent to a threat to abandon\r\n",
      "you both if you are disobedient, and to abandon you now after summoning\r\n",
      "you to Petersburg. Well, what do you think? Can one resent such an\r\n",
      "expression from Luzhin, as we should if he (he pointed to Razumihin) had\r\n",
      "written it, or Zossimov, or one of us?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no,” answered Dounia, with more animation. “I saw clearly that it\r\n",
      "was too naïvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill\r\n",
      "in writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect,\r\n",
      "indeed...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he\r\n",
      "intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression\r\n",
      "in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I\r\n",
      "gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed\r\n",
      "with trouble, and not ‘on the pretext of the funeral,’ but simply to pay\r\n",
      "for the funeral, and not to the daughter--a young woman, as he writes,\r\n",
      "of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my\r\n",
      "life)--but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander\r\n",
      "me and to raise dissension between us. It is expressed again in legal\r\n",
      "jargon, that is to say, with a too obvious display of the aim, and\r\n",
      "with a very naïve eagerness. He is a man of intelligence, but to act\r\n",
      "sensibly, intelligence is not enough. It all shows the man and... I\r\n",
      "don’t think he has a great esteem for you. I tell you this simply to\r\n",
      "warn you, because I sincerely wish for your good...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia did not reply. Her resolution had been taken. She was only\r\n",
      "awaiting the evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then what is your decision, Rodya?” asked Pulcheria Alexandrovna, who\r\n",
      "was more uneasy than ever at the sudden, new businesslike tone of his\r\n",
      "talk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What decision?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see Pyotr Petrovitch writes that you are not to be with us this\r\n",
      "evening, and that he will go away if you come. So will you... come?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That, of course, is not for me to decide, but for you first, if you are\r\n",
      "not offended by such a request; and secondly, by Dounia, if she, too, is\r\n",
      "not offended. I will do what you think best,” he added, drily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dounia has already decided, and I fully agree with her,” Pulcheria\r\n",

      "At that moment the door was softly opened, and a young girl walked into\r\n",
      "the room, looking timidly about her. Everyone turned towards her with\r\n",
      "surprise and curiosity. At first sight, Raskolnikov did not recognise\r\n",
      "her. It was Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov. He had seen her yesterday for\r\n",
      "the first time, but at such a moment, in such surroundings and in such\r\n",
      "a dress, that his memory retained a very different image of her. Now she\r\n",
      "was a modestly and poorly-dressed young girl, very young, indeed,\r\n",
      "almost like a child, with a modest and refined manner, with a candid but\r\n",
      "somewhat frightened-looking face. She was wearing a very plain indoor\r\n",
      "dress, and had on a shabby old-fashioned hat, but she still carried a\r\n",
      "parasol. Unexpectedly finding the room full of people, she was not so\r\n",
      "much embarrassed as completely overwhelmed with shyness, like a\r\n",
      "little child. She was even about to retreat. “Oh... it’s you!” said\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, extremely astonished, and he, too, was confused. He at once\r\n",
      "recollected that his mother and sister knew through Luzhin’s letter\r\n",
      "of “some young woman of notorious behaviour.” He had only just been\r\n",
      "protesting against Luzhin’s calumny and declaring that he had seen the\r\n",
      "girl last night for the first time, and suddenly she had walked in. He\r\n",
      "remembered, too, that he had not protested against the expression “of\r\n",
      "notorious behaviour.” All this passed vaguely and fleetingly through\r\n",
      "his brain, but looking at her more intently, he saw that the humiliated\r\n",
      "creature was so humiliated that he felt suddenly sorry for her. When she\r\n",
      "made a movement to retreat in terror, it sent a pang to his heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not expect you,” he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her\r\n",
      "stop. “Please sit down. You come, no doubt, from Katerina Ivanovna.\r\n",
      "Allow me--not there. Sit here....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At Sonia’s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to\r\n",
      "enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where\r\n",
      "Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him\r\n",
      "as a bed, was too _familiar_ a place, he hurriedly motioned her to\r\n",
      "Razumihin’s chair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You sit here,” he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the\r\n",
      "two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she\r\n",
      "could sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened\r\n",
      "that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I... I... have come for one minute. Forgive me for disturbing you,” she\r\n",
      "began falteringly. “I come from Katerina Ivanovna, and she had no one to\r\n",
      "send. Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in\r\n",
      "the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her...\r\n",
      "to do her the honour... she told me to beg you...” Sonia stammered and\r\n",
      "ceased speaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I will try, certainly, most certainly,” answered Raskolnikov. He,\r\n",
      "too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence.\r\n",
      "“Please sit down,” he said, suddenly. “I want to talk to you. You are\r\n",
      "perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,” and\r\n",
      "he drew up a chair for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened\r\n",
      "look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov’s pale face\r\n",
      "flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mother,” he said, firmly and insistently, “this is Sofya Semyonovna\r\n",
      "Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run\r\n",
      "over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna glanced at Sonia, and slightly screwed up\r\n",
      "her eyes. In spite of her embarrassment before Rodya’s urgent and\r\n",
      "challenging look, she could not deny herself that satisfaction. Dounia\r\n",
      "gazed gravely and intently into the poor girl’s face, and scrutinised\r\n",
      "her with perplexity. Sonia, hearing herself introduced, tried to raise\r\n",
      "her eyes again, but was more embarrassed than ever.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I wanted to ask you,” said Raskolnikov, hastily, “how things were\r\n",
      "arranged yesterday. You were not worried by the police, for instance?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, that was all right... it was too evident, the cause of death...\r\n",
      "they did not worry us... only the lodgers are angry.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At the body’s remaining so long. You see it is hot now. So that,\r\n",
      "to-day, they will carry it to the cemetery, into the chapel, until\r\n",
      "to-morrow. At first Katerina Ivanovna was unwilling, but now she sees\r\n",
      "herself that it’s necessary...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-day, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“She is giving a funeral lunch?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes... just a little.... She told me to thank you very much for helping\r\n",
      "us yesterday. But for you, we should have had nothing for the funeral.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All at once her lips and chin began trembling, but, with an effort, she\r\n",
      "controlled herself, looking down again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the conversation, Raskolnikov watched her carefully. She had a\r\n",
      "thin, very thin, pale little face, rather irregular and angular, with a\r\n",
      "sharp little nose and chin. She could not have been called pretty, but\r\n",
      "her blue eyes were so clear, and when they lighted up, there was such\r\n",
      "a kindliness and simplicity in her expression that one could not help\r\n",
      "being attracted. Her face, and her whole figure indeed, had another\r\n",
      "peculiar characteristic. In spite of her eighteen years, she looked\r\n",
      "almost a little girl--almost a child. And in some of her gestures, this\r\n",
      "childishness seemed almost absurd.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But has Katerina Ivanovna been able to manage with such small means?\r\n",
      "Does she even mean to have a funeral lunch?” Raskolnikov asked,\r\n",
      "persistently keeping up the conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The coffin will be plain, of course... and everything will be plain, so\r\n",
      "it won’t cost much. Katerina Ivanovna and I have reckoned it all out, so\r\n",
      "that there will be enough left... and Katerina Ivanovna was very anxious\r\n",
      "it should be so. You know one can’t... it’s a comfort to her... she is\r\n",
      "like that, you know....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I understand, I understand... of course... why do you look at my room\r\n",
      "like that? My mother has just said it is like a tomb.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You gave us everything yesterday,” Sonia said suddenly, in reply, in a\r\n",
      "loud rapid whisper; and again she looked down in confusion. Her lips\r\n",
      "and chin were trembling once more. She had been struck at once\r\n",
      "by Raskolnikov’s poor surroundings, and now these words broke out\r\n",
      "spontaneously. A silence followed. There was a light in Dounia’s eyes,\r\n",
      "and even Pulcheria Alexandrovna looked kindly at Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Rodya,” she said, getting up, “we shall have dinner together, of\r\n",
      "course. Come, Dounia.... And you, Rodya, had better go for a little\r\n",
      "walk, and then rest and lie down before you come to see us.... I am\r\n",
      "afraid we have exhausted you....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I’ll come,” he answered, getting up fussily. “But I have\r\n",
      "something to see to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But surely you will have dinner together?” cried Razumihin, looking in\r\n",
      "surprise at Raskolnikov. “What do you mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, I am coming... of course, of course! And you stay a minute.\r\n",
      "You do not want him just now, do you, mother? Or perhaps I am taking him\r\n",
      "from you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, no. And will you, Dmitri Prokofitch, do us the favour of dining\r\n",
      "with us?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Please do,” added Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Razumihin bowed, positively radiant. For one moment, they were all\r\n",
      "strangely embarrassed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good-bye, Rodya, that is till we meet. I do not like saying good-bye.\r\n",
      "Good-bye, Nastasya. Ah, I have said good-bye again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna meant to greet Sonia, too; but it somehow failed\r\n",
      "to come off, and she went in a flutter out of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Avdotya Romanovna seemed to await her turn, and following her mother\r\n",
      "out, gave Sonia an attentive, courteous bow. Sonia, in confusion, gave\r\n",
      "a hurried, frightened curtsy. There was a look of poignant discomfort\r\n",
      "in her face, as though Avdotya Romanovna’s courtesy and attention were\r\n",
      "oppressive and painful to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dounia, good-bye,” called Raskolnikov, in the passage. “Give me your\r\n",
      "hand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, I did give it to you. Have you forgotten?” said Dounia, turning\r\n",
      "warmly and awkwardly to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never mind, give it to me again.” And he squeezed her fingers warmly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia smiled, flushed, pulled her hand away, and went off quite happy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s capital,” he said to Sonia, going back and looking\r\n",
      "brightly at her. “God give peace to the dead, the living have still to\r\n",
      "live. That is right, isn’t it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked surprised at the sudden brightness of his face. He looked\r\n",
      "at her for some moments in silence. The whole history of the dead father\r\n",
      "floated before his memory in those moments....\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Heavens, Dounia,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna began, as soon as they were in\r\n",
      "the street, “I really feel relieved myself at coming away--more at ease.\r\n",
      "How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad\r\n",
      "of that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don’t you see it?\r\n",
      "Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much\r\n",
      "can be forgiven.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you were not very patient!” Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up,\r\n",
      "hotly and jealously. “Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You\r\n",
      "are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You\r\n",
      "are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both\r\n",
      "generous.... Surely he can’t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of\r\n",
      "what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Dounia, only think what a position we are in! What if Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "breaks it off?” poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He won’t be worth much if he does,” answered Dounia, sharply and\r\n",
      "contemptuously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We did well to come away,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in.\r\n",
      "“He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has\r\n",
      "a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is\r\n",
      "one to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up\r\n",
      "rooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will\r\n",
      "crush you--carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I\r\n",
      "declare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman,\r\n",
      "too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What young woman, mother?\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have a presentiment, Dounia. Well, you may believe it or not, but\r\n",
      "as soon as she came in, that very minute, I felt that she was the chief\r\n",
      "cause of the trouble....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing of the sort!” cried Dounia, in vexation. “What nonsense, with\r\n",
      "your presentiments, mother! He only made her acquaintance the evening\r\n",
      "before, and he did not know her when she came in.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you will see.... She worries me; but you will see, you will\r\n",
      "see! I was so frightened. She was gazing at me with those eyes. I could\r\n",
      "scarcely sit still in my chair when he began introducing her, do you\r\n",
      "remember? It seems so strange, but Pyotr Petrovitch writes like that\r\n",
      "about her, and he introduces her to us--to you! So he must think a great\r\n",
      "deal of her.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“People will write anything. We were talked about and written about,\r\n",

      "pledges there, too--trifles--a ring my sister gave me as a keepsake when\r\n",
      "I left home, and my father’s silver watch--they are only worth five or\r\n",
      "six roubles altogether... but I value them. So what am I to do now? I\r\n",
      "do not want to lose the things, especially the watch. I was quaking just\r\n",
      "now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia’s\r\n",
      "watch. It is the only thing of father’s left us. She would be ill if\r\n",
      "it were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I\r\n",
      "ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be\r\n",
      "better to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter\r\n",
      "might be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,” Razumihin\r\n",

      "moving rapidly along, looking at no one, noticing nothing, to think, to\r\n",
      "remember, to meditate on every word, every detail. Never, never had she\r\n",
      "felt anything like this. Dimly and unconsciously a whole new world was\r\n",
      "opening before her. She remembered suddenly that Raskolnikov meant to\r\n",
      "come to her that day, perhaps at once!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only not to-day, please, not to-day!” she kept muttering with a sinking\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She was not capable at that instant of noticing an unknown gentleman who\r\n",
      "was watching her and following at her heels. He had accompanied her from\r\n",
      "the gateway. At the moment when Razumihin, Raskolnikov, and she stood\r\n",
      "still at parting on the pavement, this gentleman, who was just passing,\r\n",
      "started on hearing Sonia’s words: “and I asked where Mr. Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "lived?” He turned a rapid but attentive look upon all three, especially\r\n",
      "upon Raskolnikov, to whom Sonia was speaking; then looked back and noted\r\n",
      "the house. All this was done in an instant as he passed, and trying not\r\n",
      "to betray his interest, he walked on more slowly as though waiting for\r\n",
      "something. He was waiting for Sonia; he saw that they were parting, and\r\n",
      "that Sonia was going home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Home? Where? I’ve seen that face somewhere,” he thought. “I must find\r\n",
      "out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the turning he crossed over, looked round, and saw Sonia coming the\r\n",
      "same way, noticing nothing. She turned the corner. He followed her on\r\n",
      "the other side. After about fifty paces he crossed over again, overtook\r\n",
      "her and kept two or three yards behind her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was a man about fifty, rather tall and thickly set, with broad high\r\n",
      "shoulders which made him look as though he stooped a little. He wore\r\n",
      "good and fashionable clothes, and looked like a gentleman of position.\r\n",
      "He carried a handsome cane, which he tapped on the pavement at each\r\n",
      "step; his gloves were spotless. He had a broad, rather pleasant face\r\n",
      "with high cheek-bones and a fresh colour, not often seen in Petersburg.\r\n",
      "His flaxen hair was still abundant, and only touched here and there with\r\n",
      "grey, and his thick square beard was even lighter than his hair.\r\n",
      "His eyes were blue and had a cold and thoughtful look; his lips were\r\n",
      "crimson. He was a remarkedly well-preserved man and looked much younger\r\n",
      "than his years.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Sonia came out on the canal bank, they were the only two persons on\r\n",
      "the pavement. He observed her dreaminess and preoccupation. On reaching\r\n",
      "the house where she lodged, Sonia turned in at the gate; he followed\r\n",
      "her, seeming rather surprised. In the courtyard she turned to the right\r\n",
      "corner. “Bah!” muttered the unknown gentleman, and mounted the stairs\r\n",
      "behind her. Only then Sonia noticed him. She reached the third storey,\r\n",
      "turned down the passage, and rang at No. 9. On the door was inscribed\r\n",
      "in chalk, “Kapernaumov, Tailor.” “Bah!” the stranger repeated again,\r\n",
      "wondering at the strange coincidence, and he rang next door, at No. 8.\r\n",
      "The doors were two or three yards apart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You lodge at Kapernaumov’s,” he said, looking at Sonia and laughing.\r\n",
      "“He altered a waistcoat for me yesterday. I am staying close here at\r\n",
      "Madame Resslich’s. How odd!” Sonia looked at him attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "before yesterday. Good-bye for the present.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia made no reply; the door opened and she slipped in. She felt for\r\n",

      "On the way to Porfiry’s, Razumihin was obviously excited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s capital, brother,” he repeated several times, “and I am glad! I\r\n",
      "am glad!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you glad about?” Raskolnikov thought to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I didn’t know that you pledged things at the old woman’s, too. And...\r\n",
      "was it long ago? I mean, was it long since you were there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a simple-hearted fool he is!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When was it?” Raskolnikov stopped still to recollect. “Two or three\r\n",
      "days before her death it must have been. But I am not going to redeem\r\n",
      "the things now,” he put in with a sort of hurried and conspicuous\r\n",
      "solicitude about the things. “I’ve not more than a silver rouble\r\n",
      "left... after last night’s accursed delirium!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid special emphasis on the delirium.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes,” Razumihin hastened to agree--with what was not clear. “Then\r\n",
      "that’s why you... were stuck... partly... you know in your delirium you\r\n",
      "were continually mentioning some rings or chains! Yes, yes... that’s\r\n",
      "clear, it’s all clear now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hullo! How that idea must have got about among them. Here this man will\r\n",
      "go to the stake for me, and I find him delighted at having it _cleared\r\n",
      "up_ why I spoke of rings in my delirium! What a hold the idea must have\r\n",
      "on all of them!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shall we find him?” he asked suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, yes,” Razumihin answered quickly. “He is a nice fellow, you will\r\n",
      "see, brother. Rather clumsy, that is to say, he is a man of polished\r\n",
      "manners, but I mean clumsy in a different sense. He is an intelligent\r\n",
      "fellow, very much so indeed, but he has his own range of ideas.... He\r\n",
      "is incredulous, sceptical, cynical... he likes to impose on people, or\r\n",
      "rather to make fun of them. His is the old, circumstantial method....\r\n",
      "But he understands his work... thoroughly.... Last year he cleared up a\r\n",
      "case of murder in which the police had hardly a clue. He is very, very\r\n",
      "anxious to make your acquaintance!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On what grounds is he so anxious?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, it’s not exactly... you see, since you’ve been ill I happen to have\r\n",
      "mentioned you several times.... So, when he heard about you... about\r\n",
      "your being a law student and not able to finish your studies, he said,\r\n",
      "‘What a pity!’ And so I concluded... from everything together, not only\r\n",
      "that; yesterday Zametov... you know, Rodya, I talked some nonsense on\r\n",
      "the way home to you yesterday, when I was drunk... I am afraid, brother,\r\n",
      "of your exaggerating it, you see.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? That they think I am a madman? Maybe they are right,” he said\r\n",
      "with a constrained smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes.... That is, pooh, no!... But all that I said (and there was\r\n",
      "something else too) it was all nonsense, drunken nonsense.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why are you apologising? I am so sick of it all!” Raskolnikov cried\r\n",
      "with exaggerated irritability. It was partly assumed, however.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know, I know, I understand. Believe me, I understand. One’s ashamed\r\n",
      "to speak of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If you are ashamed, then don’t speak of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Both were silent. Razumihin was more than ecstatic and Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "perceived it with repulsion. He was alarmed, too, by what Razumihin had\r\n",
      "just said about Porfiry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I shall have to pull a long face with him too,” he thought, with a\r\n",
      "beating heart, and he turned white, “and do it naturally, too. But the\r\n",
      "most natural thing would be to do nothing at all. Carefully do nothing\r\n",
      "at all! No, _carefully_ would not be natural again.... Oh, well, we\r\n",
      "shall see how it turns out.... We shall see... directly. Is it a good\r\n",
      "thing to go or not? The butterfly flies to the light. My heart is\r\n",
      "beating, that’s what’s bad!”\r\n",

      "find out, if it’s my ruin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I say, brother,” he said suddenly, addressing Razumihin, with a sly\r\n",

      "excited. Isn’t it so?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, brother, I assure you it’s noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair\r\n",
      "in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be\r\n",
      "writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you\r\n",
      "were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even\r\n",
      "blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed\r\n",

      "Razumihin strode in gawky and awkward, shamefaced and red as a peony,\r\n",
      "with an utterly crestfallen and ferocious expression. His face and\r\n",
      "whole figure really were ridiculous at that moment and amply justified\r\n",

      "bowed to Porfiry Petrovitch, who stood in the middle of the room\r\n",
      "looking inquiringly at them. He held out his hand and shook hands, still\r\n",
      "apparently making desperate efforts to subdue his mirth and utter a few\r\n",
      "words to introduce himself. But he had no sooner succeeded in assuming\r\n",
      "a serious air and muttering something when he suddenly glanced again as\r\n",
      "though accidentally at Razumihin, and could no longer control himself:\r\n",
      "his stifled laughter broke out the more irresistibly the more he tried\r\n",
      "to restrain it. The extraordinary ferocity with which Razumihin received\r\n",
      "this “spontaneous” mirth gave the whole scene the appearance of most\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Fool! You fiend,” he roared, waving his arm which at once struck a\r\n",

      "to the company with a fiercely scowling countenance, seeing nothing.\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch laughed and was ready to go on laughing, but\r\n",

      "corner, but he rose at the visitors’ entrance and was standing in\r\n",
      "expectation with a smile on his lips, though he looked with surprise and\r\n",
      "even it seemed incredulity at the whole scene and at Raskolnikov with a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch was wearing a dressing-gown, very clean linen, and\r\n",
      "trodden-down slippers. He was a man of about five and thirty, short,\r\n",
      "stout even to corpulence, and clean shaven. He wore his hair cut short\r\n",
      "and had a large round head, particularly prominent at the back. His\r\n",
      "soft, round, rather snub-nosed face was of a sickly yellowish colour,\r\n",
      "but had a vigorous and rather ironical expression. It would have been\r\n",
      "good-natured except for a look in the eyes, which shone with a watery,\r\n",
      "mawkish light under almost white, blinking eyelashes. The expression\r\n",
      "of those eyes was strangely out of keeping with his somewhat womanish\r\n",
      "figure, and gave it something far more serious than could be guessed at\r\n",
      "first sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as Porfiry Petrovitch heard that his visitor had a little matter\r\n",
      "of business with him, he begged him to sit down on the sofa and sat down\r\n",
      "himself on the other end, waiting for him to explain his business, with\r\n",
      "that careful and over-serious attention which is at once oppressive and\r\n",
      "embarrassing, especially to a stranger, and especially if what you are\r\n",
      "discussing is in your opinion of far too little importance for such\r\n",
      "exceptional solemnity. But in brief and coherent phrases Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "explained his business clearly and exactly, and was so well satisfied\r\n",
      "with himself that he even succeeded in taking a good look at Porfiry.\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch did not once take his eyes off him. Razumihin,\r\n",
      "sitting opposite at the same table, listened warmly and impatiently,\r\n",

      "interest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Fool,” Raskolnikov swore to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You have to give information to the police,” Porfiry replied, with a\r\n",
      "most businesslike air, “that having learnt of this incident, that is of\r\n",
      "the murder, you beg to inform the lawyer in charge of the case that such\r\n",
      "and such things belong to you, and that you desire to redeem them...\r\n",
      "or... but they will write to you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s just the point, that at the present moment,” Raskolnikov tried\r\n",
      "his utmost to feign embarrassment, “I am not quite in funds... and\r\n",
      "even this trifling sum is beyond me... I only wanted, you see, for\r\n",
      "the present to declare that the things are mine, and that when I have\r\n",
      "money....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s no matter,” answered Porfiry Petrovitch, receiving his\r\n",
      "explanation of his pecuniary position coldly, “but you can, if you\r\n",
      "prefer, write straight to me, to say, that having been informed of the\r\n",
      "matter, and claiming such and such as your property, you beg...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“On an ordinary sheet of paper?” Raskolnikov interrupted eagerly, again\r\n",
      "interested in the financial side of the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, the most ordinary,” and suddenly Porfiry Petrovitch looked with\r\n",
      "obvious irony at him, screwing up his eyes and, as it were, winking at\r\n",
      "him. But perhaps it was Raskolnikov’s fancy, for it all lasted but a\r\n",
      "moment. There was certainly something of the sort, Raskolnikov could\r\n",
      "have sworn he winked at him, goodness knows why.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He knows,” flashed through his mind like lightning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Forgive my troubling you about such trifles,” he went on, a little\r\n",
      "disconcerted, “the things are only worth five roubles, but I prize them\r\n",
      "particularly for the sake of those from whom they came to me, and I must\r\n",
      "confess that I was alarmed when I heard...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s why you were so much struck when I mentioned to Zossimov that\r\n",

      "with obvious intention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was really unbearable. Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him\r\n",
      "with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately\r\n",
      "recollected himself.\r\n",

      "difference is that I don’t contend that extraordinary people are always\r\n",
      "bound to commit breaches of morals, as you call it. In fact, I doubt\r\n",
      "whether such an argument could be published. I simply hinted that an\r\n",
      "‘extraordinary’ man has the right... that is not an official right, but\r\n",
      "an inner right to decide in his own conscience to overstep... certain\r\n",
      "obstacles, and only in case it is essential for the practical fulfilment\r\n",
      "of his idea (sometimes, perhaps, of benefit to the whole of humanity).\r\n",
      "You say that my article isn’t definite; I am ready to make it as clear\r\n",
      "as I can. Perhaps I am right in thinking you want me to; very well. I\r\n",
      "maintain that if the discoveries of Kepler and Newton could not have\r\n",
      "been made known except by sacrificing the lives of one, a dozen, a\r\n",
      "hundred, or more men, Newton would have had the right, would indeed have\r\n",
      "been in duty-bound... to _eliminate_ the dozen or the hundred men for\r\n",
      "the sake of making his discoveries known to the whole of humanity. But\r\n",
      "it does not follow from that that Newton had a right to murder people\r\n",
      "right and left and to steal every day in the market. Then, I remember, I\r\n",
      "maintain in my article that all... well, legislators and leaders of men,\r\n",
      "such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without\r\n",
      "exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they\r\n",
      "transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held\r\n",
      "sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either,\r\n",
      "if that bloodshed--often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence\r\n",
      "of ancient law--were of use to their cause. It’s remarkable, in fact,\r\n",
      "that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity\r\n",
      "were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men\r\n",
      "or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving\r\n",
      "some new word, must from their very nature be criminals--more or less,\r\n",
      "of course. Otherwise it’s hard for them to get out of the common rut;\r\n",
      "and to remain in the common rut is what they can’t submit to, from their\r\n",
      "very nature again, and to my mind they ought not, indeed, to submit to\r\n",
      "it. You see that there is nothing particularly new in all that. The\r\n",
      "same thing has been printed and read a thousand times before. As for my\r\n",
      "division of people into ordinary and extraordinary, I acknowledge that\r\n",
      "it’s somewhat arbitrary, but I don’t insist upon exact numbers. I only\r\n",
      "believe in my leading idea that men are _in general_ divided by a law\r\n",
      "of nature into two categories, inferior (ordinary), that is, so to say,\r\n",
      "material that serves only to reproduce its kind, and men who have\r\n",
      "the gift or the talent to utter _a new word_. There are, of course,\r\n",
      "innumerable sub-divisions, but the distinguishing features of both\r\n",
      "categories are fairly well marked. The first category, generally\r\n",
      "speaking, are men conservative in temperament and law-abiding; they live\r\n",
      "under control and love to be controlled. To my thinking it is their duty\r\n",
      "to be controlled, because that’s their vocation, and there is nothing\r\n",
      "humiliating in it for them. The second category all transgress the\r\n",
      "law; they are destroyers or disposed to destruction according to their\r\n",
      "capacities. The crimes of these men are of course relative and varied;\r\n",
      "for the most part they seek in very varied ways the destruction of the\r\n",
      "present for the sake of the better. But if such a one is forced for the\r\n",
      "sake of his idea to step over a corpse or wade through blood, he can, I\r\n",
      "maintain, find within himself, in his conscience, a sanction for wading\r\n",
      "through blood--that depends on the idea and its dimensions, note that.\r\n",
      "It’s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article\r\n",
      "(you remember it began with the legal question). There’s no need for\r\n",
      "such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right,\r\n",
      "they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil\r\n",
      "quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these\r\n",
      "criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or\r\n",
      "less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second\r\n",
      "the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the\r\n",
      "second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal\r\n",
      "right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me--and _vive la\r\n",
      "guerre éternelle_--till the New Jerusalem, of course!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you believe in the New Jerusalem, do you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I do,” Raskolnikov answered firmly; as he said these words and during\r\n",
      "the whole preceding tirade he kept his eyes on one spot on the carpet.\r\n",

      "“Thank you. But tell me this: how do you distinguish those extraordinary\r\n",
      "people from the ordinary ones? Are there signs at their birth? I feel\r\n",
      "there ought to be more exactitude, more external definition. Excuse the\r\n",
      "natural anxiety of a practical law-abiding citizen, but couldn’t they\r\n",
      "adopt a special uniform, for instance, couldn’t they wear something, be\r\n",
      "branded in some way? For you know if confusion arises and a member of\r\n",

      "and you really need not be uneasy for they never go very far. Of course,\r\n",

      "grades and sub-divisions of men must follow with unfailing regularity\r\n",
      "some law of nature. That law, of course, is unknown at present, but I am\r\n",
      "convinced that it exists, and one day may become known. The vast mass of\r\n",
      "mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort,\r\n",
      "by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and\r\n",
      "stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a\r\n",
      "thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps--I\r\n",
      "speak roughly, approximately--is born with some independence, and with\r\n",
      "still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius\r\n",
      "is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity,\r\n",
      "appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have\r\n",
      "not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there\r\n",

      "thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is\r\n",
      "exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed\r\n",

      "my anxiety as to the two grades getting mixed, but... there are various\r\n",
      "practical possibilities that make me uneasy! What if some man or youth\r\n",
      "imagines that he is a Lycurgus or Mahomet--a future one of course--and\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What then?” Raskolnikov smiled in reply; “that’s not my fault. So it is\r\n",
      "and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin)\r\n",
      "that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons,\r\n",

      "last.... Yes, by the way,” he cried, seemingly suddenly delighted, “I\r\n",
      "just remember, what was I thinking of?” he turned to Razumihin, “you\r\n",
      "were talking my ears off about that Nikolay... of course, I know, I know\r\n",
      "very well,” he turned to Raskolnikov, “that the fellow is innocent, but\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very\r\n",
      "moment he spoke that he need not have said it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“I don’t believe it, I can’t believe it!” repeated Razumihin, trying in\r\n",
      "perplexity to refute Raskolnikov’s arguments.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were by now approaching Bakaleyev’s lodgings, where Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna and Dounia had been expecting them a long while. Razumihin\r\n",
      "kept stopping on the way in the heat of discussion, confused and excited\r\n",
      "by the very fact that they were for the first time speaking openly about\r\n",
      "_it_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t believe it, then!” answered Raskolnikov, with a cold, careless\r\n",
      "smile. “You were noticing nothing as usual, but I was weighing every\r\n",
      "word.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are suspicious. That is why you weighed their words... h’m...\r\n",
      "certainly, I agree, Porfiry’s tone was rather strange, and still\r\n",
      "more that wretch Zametov!... You are right, there was something about\r\n",
      "him--but why? Why?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has changed his mind since last night.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite the contrary! If they had that brainless idea, they would do\r\n",
      "their utmost to hide it, and conceal their cards, so as to catch you\r\n",
      "afterwards.... But it was all impudent and careless.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If they had had facts--I mean, real facts--or at least grounds for\r\n",
      "suspicion, then they would certainly have tried to hide their game,\r\n",
      "in the hope of getting more (they would have made a search long ago\r\n",
      "besides). But they have no facts, not one. It is all mirage--all\r\n",
      "ambiguous. Simply a floating idea. So they try to throw me out by\r\n",
      "impudence. And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted\r\n",
      "it out in his vexation--or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an\r\n",
      "intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to\r\n",
      "know. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome\r\n",
      "explaining it all. Stop!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And it’s insulting, insulting! I understand you. But... since we have\r\n",
      "spoken openly now (and it is an excellent thing that we have at last--I\r\n",
      "am glad) I will own now frankly that I noticed it in them long ago,\r\n",
      "this idea. Of course the merest hint only--an insinuation--but why an\r\n",
      "insinuation even? How dare they? What foundation have they? If only you\r\n",
      "knew how furious I have been. Think only! Simply because a poor student,\r\n",
      "unhinged by poverty and hypochondria, on the eve of a severe delirious\r\n",
      "illness (note that), suspicious, vain, proud, who has not seen a soul to\r\n",
      "speak to for six months, in rags and in boots without soles, has to\r\n",
      "face some wretched policemen and put up with their insolence; and\r\n",
      "the unexpected debt thrust under his nose, the I.O.U. presented\r\n",
      "by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling\r\n",
      "atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person\r\n",
      "where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach--he\r\n",
      "might well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it\r\n",
      "all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place,\r\n",
      "Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces,\r\n",
      "and spit a dozen times in all directions. I’d hit out in all\r\n",
      "directions, neatly too, and so I’d put an end to it. Damn them! Don’t be\r\n",
      "downhearted. It’s a shame!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He really has put it well, though,” Raskolnikov thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Damn them? But the cross-examination again, to-morrow?” he said with\r\n",
      "bitterness. “Must I really enter into explanations with them? I feel\r\n",
      "vexed as it is, that I condescended to speak to Zametov yesterday in the\r\n",
      "restaurant....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Damn it! I will go myself to Porfiry. I will squeeze it out of him, as\r\n",
      "one of the family: he must let me know the ins and outs of it all! And\r\n",
      "as for Zametov...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“At last he sees through him!” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stay!” cried Razumihin, seizing him by the shoulder again. “Stay! you\r\n",
      "were wrong. I have thought it out. You are wrong! How was that a trap?\r\n",
      "You say that the question about the workmen was a trap. But if you had\r\n",
      "done _that_, could you have said you had seen them painting the flat...\r\n",
      "and the workmen? On the contrary, you would have seen nothing, even if\r\n",
      "you had seen it. Who would own it against himself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“If I had done _that thing_, I should certainly have said that I had\r\n",
      "seen the workmen and the flat,” Raskolnikov answered, with reluctance\r\n",
      "and obvious disgust.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But why speak against yourself?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Because only peasants, or the most inexperienced novices deny\r\n",
      "everything flatly at examinations. If a man is ever so little developed\r\n",
      "and experienced, he will certainly try to admit all the external facts\r\n",
      "that can’t be avoided, but will seek other explanations of them, will\r\n",
      "introduce some special, unexpected turn, that will give them another\r\n",
      "significance and put them in another light. Porfiry might well reckon\r\n",
      "that I should be sure to answer so, and say I had seen them to give an\r\n",
      "air of truth, and then make some explanation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But he would have told you at once that the workmen could not have been\r\n",
      "there two days before, and that therefore you must have been there on\r\n",
      "the day of the murder at eight o’clock. And so he would have caught you\r\n",
      "over a detail.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, that is what he was reckoning on, that I should not have time to\r\n",
      "reflect, and should be in a hurry to make the most likely answer, and\r\n",
      "so would forget that the workmen could not have been there two days\r\n",
      "before.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But how could you forget it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing easier. It is in just such stupid things clever people are most\r\n",
      "easily caught. The more cunning a man is, the less he suspects that he\r\n",
      "will be caught in a simple thing. The more cunning a man is, the simpler\r\n",
      "the trap he must be caught in. Porfiry is not such a fool as you\r\n",
      "think....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is a knave then, if that is so!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov could not help laughing. But at the very moment, he was\r\n",
      "struck by the strangeness of his own frankness, and the eagerness\r\n",
      "with which he had made this explanation, though he had kept up all the\r\n",
      "preceding conversation with gloomy repulsion, obviously with a motive,\r\n",
      "from necessity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am getting a relish for certain aspects!” he thought to himself.\r\n",
      "But almost at the same instant he became suddenly uneasy, as though an\r\n",
      "unexpected and alarming idea had occurred to him. His uneasiness kept on\r\n",
      "increasing. They had just reached the entrance to Bakaleyev’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go in alone!” said Raskolnikov suddenly. “I will be back directly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are you going? Why, we are just here.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t help it.... I will come in half an hour. Tell them.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Say what you like, I will come with you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You, too, want to torture me!” he screamed, with such bitter\r\n",
      "irritation, such despair in his eyes that Razumihin’s hands dropped.\r\n",
      "He stood for some time on the steps, looking gloomily at Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "striding rapidly away in the direction of his lodging. At last, gritting\r\n",
      "his teeth and clenching his fist, he swore he would squeeze Porfiry\r\n",
      "like a lemon that very day, and went up the stairs to reassure Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna, who was by now alarmed at their long absence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Raskolnikov got home, his hair was soaked with sweat and he was\r\n",
      "breathing heavily. He went rapidly up the stairs, walked into his\r\n",
      "unlocked room and at once fastened the latch. Then in senseless terror\r\n",
      "he rushed to the corner, to that hole under the paper where he had put\r\n",
      "the things; put his hand in, and for some minutes felt carefully in the\r\n",
      "hole, in every crack and fold of the paper. Finding nothing, he got up\r\n",
      "and drew a deep breath. As he was reaching the steps of Bakaleyev’s, he\r\n",
      "suddenly fancied that something, a chain, a stud or even a bit of paper\r\n",
      "in which they had been wrapped with the old woman’s handwriting on it,\r\n",
      "might somehow have slipped out and been lost in some crack, and then\r\n",
      "might suddenly turn up as unexpected, conclusive evidence against him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood as though lost in thought, and a strange, humiliated, half\r\n",
      "senseless smile strayed on his lips. He took his cap at last and went\r\n",
      "quietly out of the room. His ideas were all tangled. He went dreamily\r\n",
      "through the gateway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here he is himself,” shouted a loud voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The porter was standing at the door of his little room and was pointing\r\n",
      "him out to a short man who looked like an artisan, wearing a long coat\r\n",
      "and a waistcoat, and looking at a distance remarkably like a woman. He\r\n",
      "stooped, and his head in a greasy cap hung forward. From his wrinkled\r\n",
      "flabby face he looked over fifty; his little eyes were lost in fat and\r\n",
      "they looked out grimly, sternly and discontentedly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” Raskolnikov asked, going up to the porter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man stole a look at him from under his brows and he looked at him\r\n",
      "attentively, deliberately; then he turned slowly and went out of the\r\n",
      "gate into the street without saying a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, he there was asking whether a student lived here, mentioned your\r\n",
      "name and whom you lodged with. I saw you coming and pointed you out and\r\n",
      "he went away. It’s funny.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The porter too seemed rather puzzled, but not much so, and after\r\n",
      "wondering for a moment he turned and went back to his room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov ran after the stranger, and at once caught sight of\r\n",
      "him walking along the other side of the street with the same even,\r\n",
      "deliberate step with his eyes fixed on the ground, as though in\r\n",
      "meditation. He soon overtook him, but for some time walked behind him.\r\n",
      "At last, moving on to a level with him, he looked at his face. The man\r\n",
      "noticed him at once, looked at him quickly, but dropped his eyes again;\r\n",
      "and so they walked for a minute side by side without uttering a word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were inquiring for me... of the porter?” Raskolnikov said at last,\r\n",
      "but in a curiously quiet voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man made no answer; he didn’t even look at him. Again they were both\r\n",
      "silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you... come and ask for me... and say nothing.... What’s the\r\n",
      "meaning of it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s voice broke and he seemed unable to articulate the words\r\n",
      "clearly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man raised his eyes this time and turned a gloomy sinister look at\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Murderer!” he said suddenly in a quiet but clear and distinct voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went on walking beside him. His legs felt suddenly weak, a\r\n",
      "cold shiver ran down his spine, and his heart seemed to stand still for\r\n",
      "a moment, then suddenly began throbbing as though it were set free. So\r\n",
      "they walked for about a hundred paces, side by side in silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man did not look at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean... what is.... Who is a murderer?” muttered\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov hardly audibly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“_You_ are a murderer,” the man answered still more articulately and\r\n",
      "emphatically, with a smile of triumphant hatred, and again he looked\r\n",
      "straight into Raskolnikov’s pale face and stricken eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They had just reached the cross-roads. The man turned to the left\r\n",
      "without looking behind him. Raskolnikov remained standing, gazing after\r\n",
      "him. He saw him turn round fifty paces away and look back at him still\r\n",
      "standing there. Raskolnikov could not see clearly, but he fancied that\r\n",
      "he was again smiling the same smile of cold hatred and triumph.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With slow faltering steps, with shaking knees, Raskolnikov made his way\r\n",
      "back to his little garret, feeling chilled all over. He took off his cap\r\n",
      "and put it on the table, and for ten minutes he stood without moving.\r\n",
      "Then he sank exhausted on the sofa and with a weak moan of pain he\r\n",
      "stretched himself on it. So he lay for half an hour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought of nothing. Some thoughts or fragments of thoughts, some\r\n",
      "images without order or coherence floated before his mind--faces of\r\n",
      "people he had seen in his childhood or met somewhere once, whom he would\r\n",
      "never have recalled, the belfry of the church at V., the billiard table\r\n",
      "in a restaurant and some officers playing billiards, the smell of cigars\r\n",
      "in some underground tobacco shop, a tavern room, a back staircase quite\r\n",
      "dark, all sloppy with dirty water and strewn with egg-shells, and the\r\n",
      "Sunday bells floating in from somewhere.... The images followed one\r\n",
      "another, whirling like a hurricane. Some of them he liked and tried\r\n",
      "to clutch at, but they faded and all the while there was an oppression\r\n",
      "within him, but it was not overwhelming, sometimes it was even\r\n",
      "pleasant.... The slight shivering still persisted, but that too\r\n",
      "was an almost pleasant sensation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard the hurried footsteps of Razumihin; he closed his eyes and\r\n",
      "pretended to be asleep. Razumihin opened the door and stood for some\r\n",
      "time in the doorway as though hesitating, then he stepped softly into\r\n",
      "the room and went cautiously to the sofa. Raskolnikov heard Nastasya’s\r\n",
      "whisper:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t disturb him! Let him sleep. He can have his dinner later.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite so,” answered Razumihin. Both withdrew carefully and closed the\r\n",
      "door. Another half-hour passed. Raskolnikov opened his eyes, turned on\r\n",
      "his back again, clasping his hands behind his head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is he? Who is that man who sprang out of the earth? Where was he,\r\n",
      "what did he see? He has seen it all, that’s clear. Where was he then?\r\n",
      "And from where did he see? Why has he only now sprung out of the earth?\r\n",
      "And how could he see? Is it possible? Hm...” continued Raskolnikov,\r\n",
      "turning cold and shivering, “and the jewel case Nikolay found behind the\r\n",
      "door--was that possible? A clue? You miss an infinitesimal line and you\r\n",
      "can build it into a pyramid of evidence! A fly flew by and saw it! Is it\r\n",
      "possible?” He felt with sudden loathing how weak, how physically weak he\r\n",
      "had become. “I ought to have known it,” he thought with a bitter smile.\r\n",
      "“And how dared I, knowing myself, knowing how I should be, take up an\r\n",
      "axe and shed blood! I ought to have known beforehand.... Ah, but I did\r\n",
      "know!” he whispered in despair. At times he came to a standstill at some\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, those men are not made so. The real _Master_ to whom all is\r\n",
      "permitted storms Toulon, makes a massacre in Paris, _forgets_ an army in\r\n",
      "Egypt, _wastes_ half a million men in the Moscow expedition and gets off\r\n",
      "with a jest at Vilna. And altars are set up to him after his death, and\r\n",
      "so _all_ is permitted. No, such people, it seems, are not of flesh but\r\n",
      "of bronze!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One sudden irrelevant idea almost made him laugh. Napoleon, the\r\n",
      "pyramids, Waterloo, and a wretched skinny old woman, a pawnbroker with\r\n",
      "a red trunk under her bed--it’s a nice hash for Porfiry Petrovitch to\r\n",
      "digest! How can they digest it! It’s too inartistic. “A Napoleon creep\r\n",
      "under an old woman’s bed! Ugh, how loathsome!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At moments he felt he was raving. He sank into a state of feverish\r\n",
      "excitement. “The old woman is of no consequence,” he thought, hotly and\r\n",
      "incoherently. “The old woman was a mistake perhaps, but she is not\r\n",
      "what matters! The old woman was only an illness.... I was in a hurry to\r\n",
      "overstep.... I didn’t kill a human being, but a principle! I killed the\r\n",
      "principle, but I didn’t overstep, I stopped on this side.... I was\r\n",
      "only capable of killing. And it seems I wasn’t even capable of that...\r\n",
      "Principle? Why was that fool Razumihin abusing the socialists? They are\r\n",
      "industrious, commercial people; ‘the happiness of all’ is their case.\r\n",
      "No, life is only given to me once and I shall never have it again; I\r\n",
      "don’t want to wait for ‘the happiness of all.’ I want to live myself,\r\n",
      "or else better not live at all. I simply couldn’t pass by my mother\r\n",
      "starving, keeping my rouble in my pocket while I waited for the\r\n",
      "‘happiness of all.’ I am putting my little brick into the happiness of\r\n",
      "all and so my heart is at peace. Ha-ha! Why have you let me slip? I only\r\n",
      "live once, I too want.... Ech, I am an æsthetic louse and nothing\r\n",
      "more,” he added suddenly, laughing like a madman. “Yes, I am certainly a\r\n",
      "louse,” he went on, clutching at the idea, gloating over it and playing\r\n",
      "with it with vindictive pleasure. “In the first place, because I can\r\n",
      "reason that I am one, and secondly, because for a month past I have been\r\n",
      "troubling benevolent Providence, calling it to witness that not for\r\n",
      "my own fleshly lusts did I undertake it, but with a grand and noble\r\n",
      "object--ha-ha! Thirdly, because I aimed at carrying it out as justly as\r\n",
      "possible, weighing, measuring and calculating. Of all the lice I picked\r\n",
      "out the most useless one and proposed to take from her only as much as I\r\n",
      "needed for the first step, no more nor less (so the rest would have gone\r\n",
      "to a monastery, according to her will, ha-ha!). And what shows that I\r\n",
      "am utterly a louse,” he added, grinding his teeth, “is that I am\r\n",
      "perhaps viler and more loathsome than the louse I killed, and _I felt\r\n",
      "beforehand_ that I should tell myself so _after_ killing her. Can\r\n",
      "anything be compared with the horror of that? The vulgarity! The\r\n",
      "abjectness! I understand the ‘prophet’ with his sabre, on his steed:\r\n",
      "Allah commands and ‘trembling’ creation must obey! The ‘prophet’ is\r\n",
      "right, he is right when he sets a battery across the street and blows up\r\n",
      "the innocent and the guilty without deigning to explain! It’s for you to\r\n",
      "obey, trembling creation, and not _to have desires_, for that’s not for\r\n",
      "you!... I shall never, never forgive the old woman!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His hair was soaked with sweat, his quivering lips were parched, his\r\n",
      "eyes were fixed on the ceiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Mother, sister--how I loved them! Why do I hate them now? Yes, I hate\r\n",
      "them, I feel a physical hatred for them, I can’t bear them near me....\r\n",
      "I went up to my mother and kissed her, I remember.... To embrace her\r\n",
      "and think if she only knew... shall I tell her then? That’s just what\r\n",
      "I might do.... _She_ must be the same as I am,” he added, straining\r\n",
      "himself to think, as it were struggling with delirium. “Ah, how I hate\r\n",
      "the old woman now! I feel I should kill her again if she came to life!\r\n",
      "Poor Lizaveta! Why did she come in?... It’s strange though, why is it\r\n",

      "He lost consciousness; it seemed strange to him that he didn’t remember\r\n",
      "how he got into the street. It was late evening. The twilight had fallen\r\n",
      "and the full moon was shining more and more brightly; but there was a\r\n",
      "peculiar breathlessness in the air. There were crowds of people in the\r\n",
      "street; workmen and business people were making their way home; other\r\n",
      "people had come out for a walk; there was a smell of mortar, dust and\r\n",
      "stagnant water. Raskolnikov walked along, mournful and anxious; he was\r\n",
      "distinctly aware of having come out with a purpose, of having to do\r\n",
      "something in a hurry, but what it was he had forgotten. Suddenly he\r\n",
      "stood still and saw a man standing on the other side of the street,\r\n",
      "beckoning to him. He crossed over to him, but at once the man turned and\r\n",
      "walked away with his head hanging, as though he had made no sign to\r\n",
      "him. “Stay, did he really beckon?” Raskolnikov wondered, but he tried\r\n",
      "to overtake him. When he was within ten paces he recognised him and\r\n",
      "was frightened; it was the same man with stooping shoulders in the long\r\n",
      "coat. Raskolnikov followed him at a distance; his heart was beating;\r\n",
      "they went down a turning; the man still did not look round. “Does he\r\n",
      "know I am following him?” thought Raskolnikov. The man went into the\r\n",
      "gateway of a big house. Raskolnikov hastened to the gate and looked in\r\n",
      "to see whether he would look round and sign to him. In the court-yard\r\n",
      "the man did turn round and again seemed to beckon him. Raskolnikov at\r\n",
      "once followed him into the yard, but the man was gone. He must have\r\n",
      "gone up the first staircase. Raskolnikov rushed after him. He heard\r\n",
      "slow measured steps two flights above. The staircase seemed strangely\r\n",
      "familiar. He reached the window on the first floor; the moon shone\r\n",
      "through the panes with a melancholy and mysterious light; then he\r\n",
      "reached the second floor. Bah! this is the flat where the painters were\r\n",
      "at work... but how was it he did not recognise it at once? The steps\r\n",
      "of the man above had died away. “So he must have stopped or hidden\r\n",
      "somewhere.” He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a\r\n",
      "stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own\r\n",
      "footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be\r\n",
      "hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he\r\n",
      "hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as\r\n",
      "though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour\r\n",
      "which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the\r\n",
      "chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the\r\n",
      "frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows.\r\n",
      "“It’s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,” thought\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. He stood and waited, waited a long while, and the more\r\n",
      "silent the moonlight, the more violently his heart beat, till it was\r\n",
      "painful. And still the same hush. Suddenly he heard a momentary sharp\r\n",
      "crack like the snapping of a splinter and all was still again. A fly\r\n",
      "flew up suddenly and struck the window pane with a plaintive buzz. At\r\n",
      "that moment he noticed in the corner between the window and the little\r\n",
      "cupboard something like a cloak hanging on the wall. “Why is that cloak\r\n",
      "here?” he thought, “it wasn’t there before....” He went up to it quietly\r\n",
      "and felt that there was someone hiding behind it. He cautiously moved\r\n",
      "the cloak and saw, sitting on a chair in the corner, the old woman bent\r\n",
      "double so that he couldn’t see her face; but it was she. He stood over\r\n",
      "her. “She is afraid,” he thought. He stealthily took the axe from the\r\n",
      "noose and struck her one blow, then another on the skull. But strange\r\n",
      "to say she did not stir, as though she were made of wood. He was\r\n",
      "frightened, bent down nearer and tried to look at her; but she, too,\r\n",
      "bent her head lower. He bent right down to the ground and peeped up\r\n",
      "into her face from below, he peeped and turned cold with horror: the old\r\n",
      "woman was sitting and laughing, shaking with noiseless laughter, doing\r\n",
      "her utmost that he should not hear it. Suddenly he fancied that the door\r\n",
      "from the bedroom was opened a little and that there was laughter and\r\n",
      "whispering within. He was overcome with frenzy and he began hitting the\r\n",
      "old woman on the head with all his force, but at every blow of the axe\r\n",
      "the laughter and whispering from the bedroom grew louder and the old\r\n",
      "woman was simply shaking with mirth. He was rushing away, but the\r\n",
      "passage was full of people, the doors of the flats stood open and on the\r\n",
      "landing, on the stairs and everywhere below there were people, rows of\r\n",
      "heads, all looking, but huddled together in silence and expectation.\r\n",
      "Something gripped his heart, his legs were rooted to the spot, they\r\n",
      "would not move.... He tried to scream and woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He drew a deep breath--but his dream seemed strangely to persist:\r\n",
      "his door was flung open and a man whom he had never seen stood in the\r\n",
      "doorway watching him intently.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had hardly opened his eyes and he instantly closed them\r\n",
      "again. He lay on his back without stirring.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it still a dream?” he wondered and again raised his eyelids hardly\r\n",
      "perceptibly; the stranger was standing in the same place, still watching\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stepped cautiously into the room, carefully closing the door after\r\n",
      "him, went up to the table, paused a moment, still keeping his eyes on\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, and noiselessly seated himself on the chair by the sofa; he\r\n",
      "put his hat on the floor beside him and leaned his hands on his cane\r\n",
      "and his chin on his hands. It was evident that he was prepared to wait\r\n",
      "indefinitely. As far as Raskolnikov could make out from his stolen\r\n",
      "glances, he was a man no longer young, stout, with a full, fair, almost\r\n",
      "whitish beard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ten minutes passed. It was still light, but beginning to get dusk. There\r\n",
      "was complete stillness in the room. Not a sound came from the stairs.\r\n",
      "Only a big fly buzzed and fluttered against the window pane. It was\r\n",
      "unbearable at last. Raskolnikov suddenly got up and sat on the sofa.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, tell me what you want.”\r\n",

      "calamity, morally, in a way, by irritation or something of the\r\n",

      "the last drop; for the last three days Marfa Petrovna had been forced to\r\n",

      "she had bored them so with that letter (you heard about her reading the\r\n",
      "letter). And all of a sudden those two switches fell from heaven! Her\r\n",
      "first act was to order the carriage to be got out.... Not to speak\r\n",
      "of the fact that there are cases when women are very, very glad to be\r\n",
      "insulted in spite of all their show of indignation. There are instances\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At one time Raskolnikov thought of getting up and walking out and so\r\n",

      "pleased with me. I only used the whip twice in all our seven years (not\r\n",
      "counting a third occasion of a very ambiguous character). The first\r\n",
      "time, two months after our marriage, immediately after we arrived in the\r\n",
      "country, and the last time was that of which we are speaking. Did you\r\n",
      "suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver?\r\n",
      "Ha, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years\r\n",
      "ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I’ve forgotten\r\n",
      "his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having\r\n",
      "thrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in\r\n",
      "those days, that very year I believe, the ‘disgraceful action of the\r\n",
      "_Age_’ took place (you know, ‘The Egyptian Nights,’ that public reading,\r\n",
      "you remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth,\r\n",
      "where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German,\r\n",
      "I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there\r\n",
      "for sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking\r\n",
      "‘Germans’ that I don’t believe there is a progressive who could quite\r\n",
      "answer for himself. No one looked at the subject from that point of view\r\n",
      "then, but that’s the truly humane point of view, I assure you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After saying this, Svidrigaïlov broke into a sudden laugh again.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov saw clearly that this was a man with a firm purpose in his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I expect you’ve not talked to anyone for some days?” he asked.\r\n",

      "delighted to see you.... Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, but you\r\n",
      "seem to be somehow awfully strange yourself. Say what you like, there’s\r\n",
      "something wrong with you, and now, too... not this very minute, I mean,\r\n",

      "climate... and especially if one has a natural propensity that way,” he\r\n",
      "added, laughing again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I’ve heard you have many friends here. You are, as they say, ‘not\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That’s true that I have friends here,” Svidrigaïlov admitted, not\r\n",

      "about for the last three days, and I’ve seen them, or they’ve seen me.\r\n",
      "That’s a matter of course. I am well dressed and reckoned not a poor\r\n",
      "man; the emancipation of the serfs hasn’t affected me; my property\r\n",
      "consists chiefly of forests and water meadows. The revenue has not\r\n",
      "fallen off; but... I am not going to see them, I was sick of them long\r\n",
      "ago. I’ve been here three days and have called on no one.... What a town\r\n",
      "it is! How has it come into existence among us, tell me that? A town of\r\n",

      "afterwards. At last I was left alone in my study. I lighted a cigar and\r\n",
      "began to think), she came in at the door. ‘You’ve been so busy to-day,\r\n",
      "Arkady Ivanovitch, you have forgotten to wind the dining-room clock,’\r\n",
      "she said. All those seven years I’ve wound that clock every week, and if\r\n",
      "I forgot it she would always remind me. The next day I set off on my way\r\n",
      "here. I got out at the station at daybreak; I’d been asleep, tired out,\r\n",
      "with my eyes half open, I was drinking some coffee. I looked up and\r\n",
      "there was suddenly Marfa Petrovna sitting beside me with a pack of\r\n",
      "cards in her hands. ‘Shall I tell your fortune for the journey, Arkady\r\n",
      "Ivanovitch?’ She was a great hand at telling fortunes. I shall never\r\n",
      "forgive myself for not asking her to. I ran away in a fright, and,\r\n",
      "besides, the bell rang. I was sitting to-day, feeling very heavy after a\r\n",
      "miserable dinner from a cookshop; I was sitting smoking, all of a sudden\r\n",
      "Marfa Petrovna again. She came in very smart in a new green silk dress\r\n",
      "with a long train. ‘Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my\r\n",
      "dress? Aniska can’t make like this.’ (Aniska was a dressmaker in the\r\n",
      "country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a\r\n",
      "pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress,\r\n",
      "and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. ‘I wonder\r\n",
      "you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘Good\r\n",
      "gracious, you won’t let one disturb you about anything!’ To tease her\r\n",
      "I said, ‘I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.’ ‘That’s just like you,\r\n",
      "Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a\r\n",
      "bride when you’ve hardly buried your wife. And if you could make a good\r\n",
      "choice, at least, but I know it won’t be for your happiness or hers, you\r\n",
      "will only be a laughing-stock to all good people.’ Then she went out and\r\n",
      "her train seemed to rustle. Isn’t it nonsense, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But perhaps you are telling lies?” Raskolnikov put in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I rarely lie,” answered Svidrigaïlov thoughtfully, apparently not\r\n",
      "noticing the rudeness of the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And in the past, have you ever seen ghosts before?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Y-yes, I have seen them, but only once in my life, six years ago. I had\r\n",
      "a serf, Filka; just after his burial I called out forgetting ‘Filka, my\r\n",
      "pipe!’ He came in and went to the cupboard where my pipes were. I sat\r\n",
      "still and thought ‘he is doing it out of revenge,’ because we had a\r\n",
      "violent quarrel just before his death. ‘How dare you come in with a hole\r\n",
      "in your elbow?’ I said. ‘Go away, you scamp!’ He turned and went out,\r\n",
      "and never came again. I didn’t tell Marfa Petrovna at the time. I wanted\r\n",
      "to have a service sung for him, but I was ashamed.”\r\n",

      "“I know I am not well, without your telling me, though I don’t know\r\n",

      "ask you whether you believe that ghosts are seen, but whether you\r\n",
      "believe that they exist.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I won’t believe it!” Raskolnikov cried, with positive anger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do people generally say?” muttered Svidrigaïlov, as though\r\n",
      "speaking to himself, looking aside and bowing his head. “They say, ‘You\r\n",
      "are ill, so what appears to you is only unreal fantasy.’ But that’s not\r\n",
      "strictly logical. I agree that ghosts only appear to the sick, but that\r\n",
      "only proves that they are unable to appear except to the sick, not that\r\n",
      "they don’t exist.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing of the sort,” Raskolnikov insisted irritably.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No? You don’t think so?” Svidrigaïlov went on, looking at him\r\n",
      "deliberately. “But what do you say to this argument (help me with\r\n",
      "it): ghosts are, as it were, shreds and fragments of other worlds, the\r\n",
      "beginning of them. A man in health has, of course, no reason to see\r\n",
      "them, because he is above all a man of this earth and is bound for the\r\n",
      "sake of completeness and order to live only in this life. But as soon\r\n",
      "as one is ill, as soon as the normal earthly order of the organism is\r\n",
      "broken, one begins to realise the possibility of another world; and the\r\n",
      "more seriously ill one is, the closer becomes one’s contact with that\r\n",
      "other world, so that as soon as the man dies he steps straight into that\r\n",
      "world. I thought of that long ago. If you believe in a future life, you\r\n",
      "could believe in that, too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t believe in a future life,” said Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov sat lost in thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,”\r\n",
      " he said suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is a madman,” thought Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception,\r\n",
      "something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what\r\n",
      "if it’s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black\r\n",
      "and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that’s all eternity is? I\r\n",
      "sometimes fancy it like that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than\r\n",
      "that?” Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Juster? And how can we tell, perhaps that is just, and do you know\r\n",
      "it’s what I would certainly have made it,” answered Svidrigaïlov, with a\r\n",
      "vague smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This horrible answer sent a cold chill through Raskolnikov. Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "raised his head, looked at him, and suddenly began laughing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only think,” he cried, “half an hour ago we had never seen each other,\r\n",
      "we regarded each other as enemies; there is a matter unsettled between\r\n",
      "us; we’ve thrown it aside, and away we’ve gone into the abstract! Wasn’t\r\n",
      "I right in saying that we were birds of a feather?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Kindly allow me,” Raskolnikov went on irritably, “to ask you to explain\r\n",
      "why you have honoured me with your visit... and... and I am in a hurry,\r\n",
      "I have no time to waste. I want to go out.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By all means, by all means. Your sister, Avdotya Romanovna, is going to\r\n",
      "be married to Mr. Luzhin, Pyotr Petrovitch?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Can you refrain from any question about my sister and from mentioning\r\n",
      "her name? I can’t understand how you dare utter her name in my presence,\r\n",
      "if you really are Svidrigaïlov.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, but I’ve come here to speak about her; how can I avoid mentioning\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Very good, speak, but make haste.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Luzhin, who is a connection of mine through my wife, if you have only\r\n",
      "seen him for half an hour, or heard any facts about him. He is no\r\n",
      "match for Avdotya Romanovna. I believe Avdotya Romanovna is sacrificing\r\n",
      "herself generously and imprudently for the sake of... for the sake of\r\n",
      "her family. I fancied from all I had heard of you that you would be very\r\n",
      "glad if the match could be broken off without the sacrifice of worldly\r\n",
      "advantages. Now I know you personally, I am convinced of it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Romanovitch, if I were working for my own advantage, I would not have\r\n",
      "spoken out so directly. I am not quite a fool. I will confess something\r\n",
      "psychologically curious about that: just now, defending my love for\r\n",
      "Avdotya Romanovna, I said I was myself the victim. Well, let me tell you\r\n",
      "that I’ve no feeling of love now, not the slightest, so that I wonder\r\n",
      "myself indeed, for I really did feel something...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Through idleness and depravity,” Raskolnikov put in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I certainly am idle and depraved, but your sister has such qualities\r\n",
      "that even I could not help being impressed by them. But that’s all\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the\r\n",
      "day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I\r\n",
      "still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object\r\n",
      "of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a\r\n",
      "certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary\r\n",
      "arrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided\r\n",
      "for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should\r\n",
      "make, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year\r\n",
      "ago. That’s enough for me. Excuse me, I am just coming to the point.\r\n",
      "Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too.\r\n",
      "It’s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled\r\n",
      "with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage.\r\n",
      "I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you\r\n",
      "like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she\r\n",
      "will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging\r\n",
      "her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten\r\n",
      "thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to\r\n",
      "which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way\r\n",
      "to it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are certainly mad,” cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as\r\n",
      "astonished. “How dare you talk like that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew you would scream at me; but in the first place, though I am not\r\n",
      "rich, this ten thousand roubles is perfectly free; I have absolutely no\r\n",
      "need for it. If Avdotya Romanovna does not accept it, I shall waste\r\n",
      "it in some more foolish way. That’s the first thing. Secondly, my\r\n",
      "conscience is perfectly easy; I make the offer with no ulterior motive.\r\n",
      "You may not believe it, but in the end Avdotya Romanovna and you will\r\n",
      "know. The point is, that I did actually cause your sister, whom I\r\n",
      "greatly respect, some trouble and unpleasantness, and so, sincerely\r\n",
      "regretting it, I want--not to compensate, not to repay her for the\r\n",
      "unpleasantness, but simply to do something to her advantage, to show\r\n",
      "that I am not, after all, privileged to do nothing but harm. If there\r\n",
      "were a millionth fraction of self-interest in my offer, I should not\r\n",
      "have made it so openly; and I should not have offered her ten thousand\r\n",
      "only, when five weeks ago I offered her more, Besides, I may, perhaps,\r\n",
      "very soon marry a young lady, and that alone ought to prevent suspicion\r\n",
      "of any design on Avdotya Romanovna. In conclusion, let me say that\r\n",
      "in marrying Mr. Luzhin, she is taking money just the same, only from\r\n",
      "another man. Don’t be angry, Rodion Romanovitch, think it over coolly\r\n",
      "and quietly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "unpardonable impertinence.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not in the least. Then a man may do nothing but harm to his neighbour\r\n",
      "in this world, and is prevented from doing the tiniest bit of good\r\n",
      "by trivial conventional formalities. That’s absurd. If I died, for\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Very likely she would.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, indeed. However, if you refuse it, so be it, though ten\r\n",

      "still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn’t speak in\r\n",
      "the right way. They don’t seem to understand and can’t understand, but\r\n",
      "are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking\r\n",
      "to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At\r\n",
      "last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I’d\r\n",
      "brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was\r\n",
      "all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn’t say a word. But, you see, I\r\n",
      "thought I’d made a mess of it, but as I went downstairs a brilliant idea\r\n",
      "struck me: why should we trouble? Of course if you were in any danger\r\n",
      "or anything, but why need you care? You needn’t care a hang for them. We\r\n",
      "shall have a laugh at them afterwards, and if I were in your place I’d\r\n",
      "mystify them more than ever. How ashamed they’ll be afterwards! Hang\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“To be sure,” answered Raskolnikov. “But what will you say to-morrow?”\r\n",

      "occurred to him to wonder what Razumihin would think when he knew. As he\r\n",
      "thought it, Raskolnikov looked at him. Razumihin’s account of his visit\r\n",
      "to Porfiry had very little interest for him, so much had come and gone\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In the corridor they came upon Luzhin; he had arrived punctually\r\n",
      "at eight, and was looking for the number, so that all three went in\r\n",
      "together without greeting or looking at one another. The young men\r\n",
      "walked in first, while Pyotr Petrovitch, for good manners, lingered a\r\n",
      "little in the passage, taking off his coat. Pulcheria Alexandrovna came\r\n",
      "forward at once to greet him in the doorway, Dounia was welcoming her\r\n",
      "brother. Pyotr Petrovitch walked in and quite amiably, though with\r\n",
      "redoubled dignity, bowed to the ladies. He looked, however, as though\r\n",
      "he were a little put out and could not yet recover himself. Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna, who seemed also a little embarrassed, hastened to make\r\n",
      "them all sit down at the round table where a samovar was boiling. Dounia\r\n",
      "and Luzhin were facing one another on opposite sides of the table.\r\n",

      "was next to Luzhin and Raskolnikov was beside his sister.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A moment’s silence followed. Pyotr Petrovitch deliberately drew out a\r\n",
      "cambric handkerchief reeking of scent and blew his nose with an air of\r\n",
      "a benevolent man who felt himself slighted, and was firmly resolved to\r\n",
      "insist on an explanation. In the passage the idea had occurred to him to\r\n",
      "keep on his overcoat and walk away, and so give the two ladies a sharp\r\n",
      "and emphatic lesson and make them feel the gravity of the position.\r\n",
      "But he could not bring himself to do this. Besides, he could not endure\r\n",
      "uncertainty, and he wanted an explanation: if his request had been so\r\n",
      "openly disobeyed, there was something behind it, and in that case it was\r\n",
      "better to find it out beforehand; it rested with him to punish them and\r\n",
      "there would always be time for that.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I am young and strong, I don’t get tired, but it was a great strain for\r\n",

      "“That’s unavoidable! our national railways are of terrible length.\r\n",
      "‘Mother Russia,’ as they say, is a vast country.... In spite of all my\r\n",
      "desire to do so, I was unable to meet you yesterday. But I trust all\r\n",
      "passed off without inconvenience?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, Pyotr Petrovitch, it was all terribly disheartening,” Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna hastened to declare with peculiar intonation, “and if\r\n",

      "we should have been utterly lost. Here, he is! Dmitri Prokofitch\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I had the pleasure... yesterday,” muttered Pyotr Petrovitch with a\r\n",
      "hostile glance sidelong at Razumihin; then he scowled and was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch belonged to that class of persons, on the surface very\r\n",
      "polite in society, who make a great point of punctiliousness, but who,\r\n",
      "directly they are crossed in anything, are completely disconcerted, and\r\n",
      "become more like sacks of flour than elegant and lively men of society.\r\n",
      "Again all was silent; Raskolnikov was obstinately mute, Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna was unwilling to open the conversation too soon. Razumihin had\r\n",
      "nothing to say, so Pulcheria Alexandrovna was anxious again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Marfa Petrovna is dead, have you heard?” she began having recourse to\r\n",
      "her leading item of conversation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To be sure, I heard so. I was immediately informed, and I have come to\r\n",
      "make you acquainted with the fact that Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "set off in haste for Petersburg immediately after his wife’s funeral. So\r\n",
      "at least I have excellent authority for believing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To Petersburg? here?” Dounia asked in alarm and looked at her mother.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, indeed, and doubtless not without some design, having in view the\r\n",
      "rapidity of his departure, and all the circumstances preceding it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! won’t he leave Dounia in peace even here?” cried\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I imagine that neither you nor Avdotya Romanovna have any grounds for\r\n",
      "uneasiness, unless, of course, you are yourselves desirous of getting\r\n",
      "into communication with him. For my part I am on my guard, and am now\r\n",
      "discovering where he is lodging.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, Pyotr Petrovitch, you would not believe what a fright you have\r\n",
      "given me,” Pulcheria Alexandrovna went on: “I’ve only seen him twice,\r\n",
      "but I thought him terrible, terrible! I am convinced that he was the\r\n",
      "cause of Marfa Petrovna’s death.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s impossible to be certain about that. I have precise information. I\r\n",
      "do not dispute that he may have contributed to accelerate the course of\r\n",
      "events by the moral influence, so to say, of the affront; but as to the\r\n",
      "general conduct and moral characteristics of that personage, I am\r\n",
      "in agreement with you. I do not know whether he is well off now, and\r\n",
      "precisely what Marfa Petrovna left him; this will be known to me within\r\n",
      "a very short period; but no doubt here in Petersburg, if he has any\r\n",
      "pecuniary resources, he will relapse at once into his old ways. He is\r\n",
      "the most depraved, and abjectly vicious specimen of that class of men.\r\n",
      "I have considerable reason to believe that Marfa Petrovna, who was so\r\n",
      "unfortunate as to fall in love with him and to pay his debts eight years\r\n",
      "ago, was of service to him also in another way. Solely by her exertions\r\n",
      "and sacrifices, a criminal charge, involving an element of fantastic\r\n",
      "and homicidal brutality for which he might well have been sentenced to\r\n",
      "Siberia, was hushed up. That’s the sort of man he is, if you care to\r\n",
      "know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna. Raskolnikov listened\r\n",
      "attentively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Are you speaking the truth when you say that you have good evidence of\r\n",
      "this?” Dounia asked sternly and emphatically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I only repeat what I was told in secret by Marfa Petrovna. I must\r\n",
      "observe that from the legal point of view the case was far from clear.\r\n",
      "There was, and I believe still is, living here a woman called Resslich,\r\n",
      "a foreigner, who lent small sums of money at interest, and did other\r\n",
      "commissions, and with this woman Svidrigaïlov had for a long while close\r\n",
      "and mysterious relations. She had a relation, a niece I believe, living\r\n",
      "with her, a deaf and dumb girl of fifteen, or perhaps not more than\r\n",
      "fourteen. Resslich hated this girl, and grudged her every crust; she\r\n",
      "used to beat her mercilessly. One day the girl was found hanging in\r\n",
      "the garret. At the inquest the verdict was suicide. After the usual\r\n",
      "proceedings the matter ended, but, later on, information was given that\r\n",
      "the child had been... cruelly outraged by Svidrigaïlov. It is true, this\r\n",
      "was not clearly established, the information was given by another German\r\n",
      "woman of loose character whose word could not be trusted; no statement\r\n",
      "was actually made to the police, thanks to Marfa Petrovna’s money and\r\n",
      "exertions; it did not get beyond gossip. And yet the story is a very\r\n",
      "significant one. You heard, no doubt, Avdotya Romanovna, when you were\r\n",
      "with them the story of the servant Philip who died of ill treatment he\r\n",
      "received six years ago, before the abolition of serfdom.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I heard, on the contrary, that this Philip hanged himself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Quite so, but what drove him, or rather perhaps disposed him,\r\n",
      "to suicide was the systematic persecution and severity of Mr.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know that,” answered Dounia, dryly. “I only heard a queer story\r\n",
      "that Philip was a sort of hypochondriac, a sort of domestic philosopher,\r\n",
      "the servants used to say, ‘he read himself silly,’ and that he hanged\r\n",
      "himself partly on account of Mr. Svidrigaïlov’s mockery of him and not\r\n",
      "his blows. When I was there he behaved well to the servants, and they\r\n",
      "were actually fond of him, though they certainly did blame him for\r\n",
      "Philip’s death.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I perceive, Avdotya Romanovna, that you seem disposed to undertake his\r\n",
      "defence all of a sudden,” Luzhin observed, twisting his lips into\r\n",
      "an ambiguous smile, “there’s no doubt that he is an astute man, and\r\n",
      "insinuating where ladies are concerned, of which Marfa Petrovna, who has\r\n",
      "died so strangely, is a terrible instance. My only desire has been to be\r\n",
      "of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed\r\n",
      "efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it’s\r\n",
      "my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor’s prison again.\r\n",
      "Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything\r\n",
      "substantial on him, having regard for his children’s interests, and,\r\n",
      "if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency,\r\n",
      "something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a\r\n",
      "man of his habits.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Pyotr Petrovitch, I beg you,” said Dounia, “say no more of Mr.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov. It makes me miserable.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He has just been to see me,” said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for\r\n",
      "the first time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch was roused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and\r\n",
      "introduced himself,” Raskolnikov continued. “He was fairly cheerful\r\n",
      "and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is\r\n",
      "particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at\r\n",
      "which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and\r\n",
      "he told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that\r\n",
      "you can receive the money very shortly.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Thank God!” cried Pulcheria Alexandrovna, crossing herself. “Pray for\r\n",
      "her soul, Dounia!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s a fact!” broke from Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell us, what more?” Dounia urged Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then he said that he wasn’t rich and all the estate was left to his\r\n",
      "children who are now with an aunt, then that he was staying somewhere\r\n",
      "not far from me, but where, I don’t know, I didn’t ask....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what, what does he want to propose to Dounia?” cried Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna in a fright. “Did he tell you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What was it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ll tell you afterwards.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov ceased speaking and turned his attention to his tea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch looked at his watch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am compelled to keep a business engagement, and so I shall not be in\r\n",
      "your way,” he added with an air of some pique and he began getting up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t go, Pyotr Petrovitch,” said Dounia, “you intended to spend\r\n",
      "the evening. Besides, you wrote yourself that you wanted to have an\r\n",
      "explanation with mother.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Precisely so, Avdotya Romanovna,” Pyotr Petrovitch answered\r\n",
      "impressively, sitting down again, but still holding his hat. “I\r\n",
      "certainly desired an explanation with you and your honoured mother upon\r\n",
      "a very important point indeed. But as your brother cannot speak openly\r\n",
      "in my presence of some proposals of Mr. Svidrigaïlov, I, too, do not\r\n",
      "desire and am not able to speak openly... in the presence of others...\r\n",
      "of certain matters of the greatest gravity. Moreover, my most weighty\r\n",
      "and urgent request has been disregarded....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Assuming an aggrieved air, Luzhin relapsed into dignified silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your request that my brother should not be present at our meeting was\r\n",
      "disregarded solely at my insistance,” said Dounia. “You wrote that you\r\n",
      "had been insulted by my brother; I think that this must be explained at\r\n",
      "once, and you must be reconciled. And if Rodya really has insulted you,\r\n",
      "then he _should_ and _will_ apologise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would\r\n",
      "not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you\r\n",
      "think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he’d hesitate--they are\r\n",
      "such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was dark in the corridor, they were standing near the lamp. For a\r\n",
      "minute they were looking at one another in silence. Razumihin remembered\r\n",
      "that minute all his life. Raskolnikov’s burning and intent eyes\r\n",
      "grew more penetrating every moment, piercing into his soul, into his\r\n",
      "consciousness. Suddenly Razumihin started. Something strange, as it\r\n",

      "Raskolnikov went straight to the house on the canal bank where Sonia\r\n",
      "lived. It was an old green house of three storeys. He found the\r\n",
      "porter and obtained from him vague directions as to the whereabouts of\r\n",
      "Kapernaumov, the tailor. Having found in the corner of the courtyard\r\n",
      "the entrance to the dark and narrow staircase, he mounted to the second\r\n",
      "floor and came out into a gallery that ran round the whole second storey\r\n",
      "over the yard. While he was wandering in the darkness, uncertain where\r\n",
      "to turn for Kapernaumov’s door, a door opened three paces from him; he\r\n",
      "mechanically took hold of it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who is there?” a woman’s voice asked uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s I... come to see you,” answered Raskolnikov and he walked into the\r\n",
      "tiny entry.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On a broken chair stood a candle in a battered copper candlestick.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s you! Good heavens!” cried Sonia weakly, and she stood rooted to\r\n",
      "the spot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Which is your room? This way?” and Raskolnikov, trying not to look at\r\n",
      "her, hastened in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A minute later Sonia, too, came in with the candle, set down the\r\n",
      "candlestick and, completely disconcerted, stood before him inexpressibly\r\n",
      "agitated and apparently frightened by his unexpected visit. The colour\r\n",
      "rushed suddenly to her pale face and tears came into her eyes... She\r\n",
      "felt sick and ashamed and happy, too.... Raskolnikov turned away quickly\r\n",
      "and sat on a chair by the table. He scanned the room in a rapid glance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a large but exceedingly low-pitched room, the only one let by the\r\n",
      "Kapernaumovs, to whose rooms a closed door led in the wall on the left.\r\n",
      "In the opposite side on the right hand wall was another door, always\r\n",
      "kept locked. That led to the next flat, which formed a separate lodging.\r\n",
      "Sonia’s room looked like a barn; it was a very irregular quadrangle and\r\n",
      "this gave it a grotesque appearance. A wall with three windows looking\r\n",
      "out on to the canal ran aslant so that one corner formed a very acute\r\n",
      "angle, and it was difficult to see in it without very strong light.\r\n",
      "The other corner was disproportionately obtuse. There was scarcely any\r\n",
      "furniture in the big room: in the corner on the right was a bedstead,\r\n",
      "beside it, nearest the door, a chair. A plain, deal table covered by a\r\n",
      "blue cloth stood against the same wall, close to the door into the other\r\n",
      "flat. Two rush-bottom chairs stood by the table. On the opposite\r\n",
      "wall near the acute angle stood a small plain wooden chest of drawers\r\n",
      "looking, as it were, lost in a desert. That was all there was in the\r\n",
      "room. The yellow, scratched and shabby wall-paper was black in the\r\n",
      "corners. It must have been damp and full of fumes in the winter. There\r\n",
      "was every sign of poverty; even the bedstead had no curtain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked in silence at her visitor, who was so attentively and\r\n",
      "unceremoniously scrutinising her room, and even began at last to tremble\r\n",
      "with terror, as though she was standing before her judge and the arbiter\r\n",
      "of her destinies.\r\n",

      "“They are very good people, very kind,” answered Sonia, who still seemed\r\n",
      "bewildered, “and all the furniture, everything... everything is theirs.\r\n",
      "And they are very kind and the children, too, often come to see me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They all stammer, don’t they?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.... He stammers and he’s lame. And his wife, too.... It’s not\r\n",
      "exactly that she stammers, but she can’t speak plainly. She is a very\r\n",
      "kind woman. And he used to be a house serf. And there are seven\r\n",
      "children... and it’s only the eldest one that stammers and the others\r\n",
      "are simply ill... but they don’t stammer.... But where did you hear\r\n",
      "about them?” she added with some surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Your father told me, then. He told me all about you.... And how you\r\n",
      "went out at six o’clock and came back at nine and how Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "knelt down by your bed.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia was confused.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I fancied I saw him to-day,” she whispered hesitatingly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Whom?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Father. I was walking in the street, out there at the corner, about ten\r\n",
      "o’clock and he seemed to be walking in front. It looked just like him. I\r\n",
      "wanted to go to Katerina Ivanovna....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were walking in the streets?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” Sonia whispered abruptly, again overcome with confusion and\r\n",
      "looking down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Katerina Ivanovna used to beat you, I dare say?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh no, what are you saying? No!” Sonia looked at him almost with\r\n",
      "dismay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You love her, then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Love her? Of course!” said Sonia with plaintive emphasis, and she\r\n",
      "clasped her hands in distress. “Ah, you don’t.... If you only knew!\r\n",
      "You see, she is quite like a child.... Her mind is quite unhinged, you\r\n",
      "see... from sorrow. And how clever she used to be... how generous... how\r\n",
      "kind! Ah, you don’t understand, you don’t understand!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia said this as though in despair, wringing her hands in excitement\r\n",
      "and distress. Her pale cheeks flushed, there was a look of anguish in\r\n",
      "her eyes. It was clear that she was stirred to the very depths, that\r\n",
      "she was longing to speak, to champion, to express something. A sort\r\n",
      "of _insatiable_ compassion, if one may so express it, was reflected in\r\n",
      "every feature of her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Beat me! how can you? Good heavens, beat me! And if she did beat me,\r\n",
      "what then? What of it? You know nothing, nothing about it.... She is so\r\n",
      "unhappy... ah, how unhappy! And ill.... She is seeking righteousness,\r\n",
      "she is pure. She has such faith that there must be righteousness\r\n",
      "everywhere and she expects it.... And if you were to torture her, she\r\n",
      "wouldn’t do wrong. She doesn’t see that it’s impossible for people to\r\n",
      "be righteous and she is angry at it. Like a child, like a child. She is\r\n",
      "good!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what will happen to you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked at him inquiringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“They are left on your hands, you see. They were all on your hands\r\n",
      "before, though.... And your father came to you to beg for drink. Well,\r\n",
      "how will it be now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know,” Sonia articulated mournfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Will they stay there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know.... They are in debt for the lodging, but the landlady,\r\n",
      "I hear, said to-day that she wanted to get rid of them, and Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna says that she won’t stay another minute.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, don’t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.” Sonia\r\n",
      "was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other\r\n",
      "little bird were to be angry. “And what could she do? What, what could\r\n",
      "she do?” she persisted, getting hot and excited. “And how she cried\r\n",
      "to-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven’t you noticed it? At one minute she\r\n",
      "is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the\r\n",
      "lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood,\r\n",
      "weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the\r\n",
      "wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again. She builds all her\r\n",
      "hopes on you; she says that you will help her now and that she will\r\n",
      "borrow a little money somewhere and go to her native town with me and\r\n",
      "set up a boarding school for the daughters of gentlemen and take me to\r\n",
      "superintend it, and we will begin a new splendid life. And she kisses\r\n",
      "and hugs me, comforts me, and you know she has such faith, such faith in\r\n",
      "her fancies! One can’t contradict her. And all the day long she has been\r\n",
      "washing, cleaning, mending. She dragged the wash tub into the room with\r\n",
      "her feeble hands and sank on the bed, gasping for breath. We went this\r\n",
      "morning to the shops to buy shoes for Polenka and Lida for theirs are\r\n",
      "quite worn out. Only the money we’d reckoned wasn’t enough, not nearly\r\n",
      "enough. And she picked out such dear little boots, for she has taste,\r\n",
      "you don’t know. And there in the shop she burst out crying before the\r\n",
      "shopmen because she hadn’t enough.... Ah, it was sad to see her....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, after that I can understand your living like this,” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "said with a bitter smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And aren’t you sorry for them? Aren’t you sorry?” Sonia flew at him\r\n",
      "again. “Why, I know, you gave your last penny yourself, though you’d\r\n",
      "seen nothing of it, and if you’d seen everything, oh dear! And how\r\n",
      "often, how often I’ve brought her to tears! Only last week! Yes, I! Only\r\n",
      "a week before his death. I was cruel! And how often I’ve done it! Ah,\r\n",
      "I’ve been wretched at the thought of it all day!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia wrung her hands as she spoke at the pain of remembering it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were cruel?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I--I. I went to see them,” she went on, weeping, “and father said,\r\n",
      "‘read me something, Sonia, my head aches, read to me, here’s a book.’ He\r\n",
      "had a book he had got from Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, he lives\r\n",
      "there, he always used to get hold of such funny books. And I said, ‘I\r\n",
      "can’t stay,’ as I didn’t want to read, and I’d gone in chiefly to show\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some\r\n",
      "collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself\r\n",
      "in the glass and was delighted with them. ‘Make me a present of them,\r\n",
      "Sonia,’ she said, ‘please do.’ ‘_Please do_,’ she said, she wanted them\r\n",
      "so much. And when could she wear them? They just reminded her of her old\r\n",
      "happy days. She looked at herself in the glass, admired herself, and she\r\n",
      "has no clothes at all, no things of her own, hasn’t had all these years!\r\n",
      "And she never asks anyone for anything; she is proud, she’d sooner give\r\n",
      "away everything. And these she asked for, she liked them so much. And I\r\n",
      "was sorry to give them. ‘What use are they to you, Katerina Ivanovna?’ I\r\n",
      "said. I spoke like that to her, I ought not to have said that! She gave\r\n",
      "me such a look. And she was so grieved, so grieved at my refusing her.\r\n",
      "And it was so sad to see.... And she was not grieved for the collars,\r\n",
      "but for my refusing, I saw that. Ah, if only I could bring it all back,\r\n",
      "change it, take back those words! Ah, if I... but it’s nothing to you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you know Lizaveta, the pedlar?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.... Did you know her?” Sonia asked with some surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Katerina Ivanovna is in consumption, rapid consumption; she will soon\r\n",
      "die,” said Raskolnikov after a pause, without answering her question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no, no, no!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Sonia unconsciously clutched both his hands, as though imploring\r\n",
      "that she should not.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But it will be better if she does die.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not better, not at all better!” Sonia unconsciously repeated in\r\n",
      "dismay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And the children? What can you do except take them to live with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, I don’t know,” cried Sonia, almost in despair, and she put her\r\n",
      "hands to her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was evident that that idea had very often occurred to her before and\r\n",
      "he had only roused it again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And, what, if even now, while Katerina Ivanovna is alive, you get ill\r\n",
      "and are taken to the hospital, what will happen then?” he persisted\r\n",
      "pitilessly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can you? That cannot be!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Sonia’s face worked with awful terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Cannot be?” Raskolnikov went on with a harsh smile. “You are not\r\n",
      "insured against it, are you? What will happen to them then? They will\r\n",
      "be in the street, all of them, she will cough and beg and knock her head\r\n",
      "against some wall, as she did to-day, and the children will cry....\r\n",
      "Then she will fall down, be taken to the police station and to the\r\n",
      "hospital, she will die, and the children...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, no.... God will not let it be!” broke at last from Sonia’s\r\n",
      "overburdened bosom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She listened, looking imploringly at him, clasping her hands in dumb\r\n",
      "entreaty, as though it all depended upon him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov got up and began to walk about the room. A minute passed.\r\n",
      "Sonia was standing with her hands and her head hanging in terrible\r\n",
      "dejection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And can’t you save? Put by for a rainy day?” he asked, stopping\r\n",
      "suddenly before her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” whispered Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course not. Have you tried?” he added almost ironically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And it didn’t come off! Of course not! No need to ask.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And again he paced the room. Another minute passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You don’t get money every day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia was more confused than ever and colour rushed into her face again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No,” she whispered with a painful effort.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It will be the same with Polenka, no doubt,” he said suddenly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no! It can’t be, no!” Sonia cried aloud in desperation, as though\r\n",
      "she had been stabbed. “God would not allow anything so awful!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He lets others come to it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no! God will protect her, God!” she repeated beside herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But, perhaps, there is no God at all,” Raskolnikov answered with a sort\r\n",
      "of malignance, laughed and looked at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia’s face suddenly changed; a tremor passed over it. She looked at\r\n",
      "him with unutterable reproach, tried to say something, but could not\r\n",
      "speak and broke into bitter, bitter sobs, hiding her face in her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You say Katerina Ivanovna’s mind is unhinged; your own mind is\r\n",
      "unhinged,” he said after a brief silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five minutes passed. He still paced up and down the room in silence, not\r\n",
      "looking at her. At last he went up to her; his eyes glittered. He put\r\n",
      "his two hands on her shoulders and looked straight into her tearful\r\n",
      "face. His eyes were hard, feverish and piercing, his lips were\r\n",
      "twitching. All at once he bent down quickly and dropping to the\r\n",
      "ground, kissed her foot. Sonia drew back from him as from a madman. And\r\n",
      "certainly he looked like a madman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you doing to me?” she muttered, turning pale, and a sudden\r\n",
      "anguish clutched at her heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood up at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did not bow down to you, I bowed down to all the suffering of\r\n",
      "humanity,” he said wildly and walked away to the window. “Listen,” he\r\n",
      "added, turning to her a minute later. “I said just now to an insolent\r\n",
      "man that he was not worth your little finger... and that I did my sister\r\n",
      "honour making her sit beside you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, you said that to them! And in her presence?” cried Sonia,\r\n",
      "frightened. “Sit down with me! An honour! Why, I’m... dishonourable....\r\n",
      "Ah, why did you say that?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you,\r\n",
      "but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that’s\r\n",
      "true,” he added almost solemnly, “and your worst sin is that you have\r\n",
      "destroyed and betrayed yourself _for nothing_. Isn’t that fearful? Isn’t\r\n",
      "it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at\r\n",
      "the same time you know yourself (you’ve only to open your eyes) that you\r\n",
      "are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,”\r\n",
      " he went on almost in a frenzy, “how this shame and degradation can exist\r\n",
      "in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be\r\n",
      "better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end\r\n",
      "it all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But what would become of them?” Sonia asked faintly, gazing at him with\r\n",
      "eyes of anguish, but not seeming surprised at his suggestion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov looked strangely at her. He read it all in her face; so she\r\n",
      "must have had that thought already, perhaps many times, and earnestly\r\n",
      "she had thought out in her despair how to end it and so earnestly, that\r\n",
      "now she scarcely wondered at his suggestion. She had not even noticed\r\n",
      "the cruelty of his words. (The significance of his reproaches and his\r\n",
      "peculiar attitude to her shame she had, of course, not noticed either,\r\n",
      "and that, too, was clear to him.) But he saw how monstrously the thought\r\n",
      "of her disgraceful, shameful position was torturing her and had long\r\n",
      "tortured her. “What, what,” he thought, “could hitherto have hindered\r\n",
      "her from putting an end to it?” Only then he realised what those poor\r\n",
      "little orphan children and that pitiful half-crazy Katerina Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "knocking her head against the wall in her consumption, meant for Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, nevertheless, it was clear to him again that with her character and\r\n",
      "the amount of education she had after all received, she could not in any\r\n",
      "case remain so. He was still confronted by the question, how could she\r\n",
      "have remained so long in that position without going out of her mind,\r\n",
      "since she could not bring herself to jump into the water? Of course he\r\n",
      "knew that Sonia’s position was an exceptional case, though unhappily not\r\n",
      "unique and not infrequent, indeed; but that very exceptionalness, her\r\n",
      "tinge of education, her previous life might, one would have thought,\r\n",
      "have killed her at the first step on that revolting path. What held her\r\n",
      "up--surely not depravity? All that infamy had obviously only touched\r\n",
      "her mechanically, not one drop of real depravity had penetrated to her\r\n",
      "heart; he saw that. He saw through her as she stood before him....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There are three ways before her,” he thought, “the canal, the madhouse,\r\n",
      "or... at last to sink into depravity which obscures the mind and turns\r\n",
      "the heart to stone.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The last idea was the most revolting, but he was a sceptic, he was\r\n",
      "young, abstract, and therefore cruel, and so he could not help believing\r\n",
      "that the last end was the most likely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But can that be true?” he cried to himself. “Can that creature who has\r\n",
      "still preserved the purity of her spirit be consciously drawn at last\r\n",
      "into that sink of filth and iniquity? Can the process already have\r\n",
      "begun? Can it be that she has only been able to bear it till now,\r\n",
      "because vice has begun to be less loathsome to her? No, no, that cannot\r\n",
      "be!” he cried, as Sonia had just before. “No, what has kept her from the\r\n",
      "canal till now is the idea of sin and they, the children.... And if she\r\n",
      "has not gone out of her mind... but who says she has not gone out of her\r\n",
      "mind? Is she in her senses? Can one talk, can one reason as she does?\r\n",
      "How can she sit on the edge of the abyss of loathsomeness into which she\r\n",
      "is slipping and refuse to listen when she is told of danger? Does she\r\n",
      "expect a miracle? No doubt she does. Doesn’t that all mean madness?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stayed obstinately at that thought. He liked that explanation indeed\r\n",
      "better than any other. He began looking more intently at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So you pray to God a great deal, Sonia?” he asked her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia did not speak; he stood beside her waiting for an answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What should I be without God?” she whispered rapidly, forcibly,\r\n",
      "glancing at him with suddenly flashing eyes, and squeezing his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, so that is it!” he thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And what does God do for you?” he asked, probing her further.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia was silent a long while, as though she could not answer. Her weak\r\n",
      "chest kept heaving with emotion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Be silent! Don’t ask! You don’t deserve!” she cried suddenly, looking\r\n",
      "sternly and wrathfully at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s it, that’s it,” he repeated to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He does everything,” she whispered quickly, looking down again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s the way out! That’s the explanation,” he decided, scrutinising\r\n",
      "her with eager curiosity, with a new, strange, almost morbid feeling.\r\n",
      "He gazed at that pale, thin, irregular, angular little face, those soft\r\n",
      "blue eyes, which could flash with such fire, such stern energy, that\r\n",
      "little body still shaking with indignation and anger--and it all seemed\r\n",
      "to him more and more strange, almost impossible. “She is a religious\r\n",
      "maniac!” he repeated to himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "facing that hateful Porfiry Petrovitch. What he dreaded above all was\r\n",
      "meeting that man again; he hated him with an intense, unmitigated hatred\r\n",
      "and was afraid his hatred might betray him. His indignation was such\r\n",
      "that he ceased trembling at once; he made ready to go in with a cold and\r\n",
      "arrogant bearing and vowed to himself to keep as silent as possible,\r\n",
      "to watch and listen and for once at least to control his overstrained\r\n",
      "nerves. At that moment he was summoned to Porfiry Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He found Porfiry Petrovitch alone in his study. His study was a room\r\n",
      "neither large nor small, furnished with a large writing-table, that\r\n",
      "stood before a sofa, upholstered in checked material, a bureau, a\r\n",
      "bookcase in the corner and several chairs--all government furniture,\r\n",
      "of polished yellow wood. In the further wall there was a closed door,\r\n",
      "beyond it there were no doubt other rooms. On Raskolnikov’s entrance\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in\r\n",
      "and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial\r\n",
      "and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had\r\n",
      "been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain”... began Porfiry,\r\n",
      "holding out both hands to him. “Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps\r\n",
      "you don’t like to be called ‘my dear fellow’ and ‘old man!’--_tout\r\n",
      "court_? Please don’t think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. “In our domain,”\r\n",
      " the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase _tout court_, were all\r\n",
      "characteristic signs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one--he drew it\r\n",
      "back in time,” struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other,\r\n",
      "but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all\r\n",
      "right or shall I copy it again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What? A paper? Yes, yes, don’t be uneasy, it’s all right,” Porfiry\r\n",
      "Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the\r\n",
      "paper and looked at it. “Yes, it’s all right. Nothing more is needed,”\r\n",
      " he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A minute later when he was talking of something else he took it from the\r\n",
      "table and put it on his bureau.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe you said yesterday you would like to question me...\r\n",
      "formally... about my acquaintance with the murdered woman?” Raskolnikov\r\n",
      "was beginning again. “Why did I put in ‘I believe’” passed through\r\n",
      "his mind in a flash. “Why am I so uneasy at having put in that ‘_I\r\n",
      "believe_’?” came in a second flash. And he suddenly felt that his\r\n",
      "uneasiness at the mere contact with Porfiry, at the first words, at the\r\n",
      "first looks, had grown in an instant to monstrous proportions, and that\r\n",
      "this was fearfully dangerous. His nerves were quivering, his emotion was\r\n",
      "increasing. “It’s bad, it’s bad! I shall say too much again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, yes! There’s no hurry, there’s no hurry,” muttered Porfiry\r\n",
      "Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim,\r\n",
      "as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table,\r\n",
      "at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov’s suspicious glance, then again\r\n",
      "standing still and looking him straight in the face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling\r\n",
      "from one side to the other and rebounding back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“We’ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a\r\n",
      "cigarette!” he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. “You know I am\r\n",
      "receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my\r\n",
      "government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to\r\n",
      "have some repairs done here. It’s almost finished now.... Government\r\n",
      "quarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, a capital thing,” answered Raskolnikov, looking at him almost\r\n",
      "ironically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A capital thing, a capital thing,” repeated Porfiry Petrovitch, as\r\n",
      "though he had just thought of something quite different. “Yes, a capital\r\n",
      "thing,” he almost shouted at last, suddenly staring at Raskolnikov and\r\n",
      "stopping short two steps from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This stupid repetition was too incongruous in its ineptitude with the\r\n",
      "serious, brooding and enigmatic glance he turned upon his visitor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But this stirred Raskolnikov’s spleen more than ever and he could not\r\n",
      "resist an ironical and rather incautious challenge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Tell me, please,” he asked suddenly, looking almost insolently at him\r\n",
      "and taking a kind of pleasure in his own insolence. “I believe it’s a\r\n",
      "sort of legal rule, a sort of legal tradition--for all investigating\r\n",
      "lawyers--to begin their attack from afar, with a trivial, or at least\r\n",
      "an irrelevant subject, so as to encourage, or rather, to divert the man\r\n",
      "they are cross-examining, to disarm his caution and then all at once to\r\n",
      "give him an unexpected knock-down blow with some fatal question. Isn’t\r\n",
      "that so? It’s a sacred tradition, mentioned, I fancy, in all the manuals\r\n",
      "of the art?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes.... Why, do you imagine that was why I spoke about government\r\n",
      "quarters... eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch screwed up his eyes and winked;\r\n",
      "a good-humoured, crafty look passed over his face. The wrinkles on his\r\n",
      "forehead were smoothed out, his eyes contracted, his features broadened\r\n",
      "and he suddenly went off into a nervous prolonged laugh, shaking all\r\n",
      "over and looking Raskolnikov straight in the face. The latter forced\r\n",
      "himself to laugh, too, but when Porfiry, seeing that he was laughing,\r\n",
      "broke into such a guffaw that he turned almost crimson, Raskolnikov’s\r\n",
      "repulsion overcame all precaution; he left off laughing, scowled and\r\n",
      "stared with hatred at Porfiry, keeping his eyes fixed on him while his\r\n",
      "intentionally prolonged laughter lasted. There was lack of precaution on\r\n",
      "both sides, however, for Porfiry Petrovitch seemed to be laughing in\r\n",
      "his visitor’s face and to be very little disturbed at the annoyance with\r\n",
      "which the visitor received it. The latter fact was very significant\r\n",
      "in Raskolnikov’s eyes: he saw that Porfiry Petrovitch had not been\r\n",
      "embarrassed just before either, but that he, Raskolnikov, had perhaps\r\n",
      "fallen into a trap; that there must be something, some motive here\r\n",
      "unknown to him; that, perhaps, everything was in readiness and in\r\n",
      "another moment would break upon him...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went straight to the point at once, rose from his seat and took his\r\n",
      "cap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began resolutely, though with considerable\r\n",
      "irritation, “yesterday you expressed a desire that I should come to you\r\n",
      "for some inquiries” (he laid special stress on the word “inquiries”). “I\r\n",
      "have come and if you have anything to ask me, ask it, and if not, allow\r\n",
      "me to withdraw. I have no time to spare.... I have to be at the funeral\r\n",
      "of that man who was run over, of whom you... know also,” he added,\r\n",
      "feeling angry at once at having made this addition and more irritated at\r\n",
      "his anger. “I am sick of it all, do you hear? and have long been. It’s\r\n",
      "partly what made me ill. In short,” he shouted, feeling that the phrase\r\n",
      "about his illness was still more out of place, “in short, kindly examine\r\n",
      "me or let me go, at once. And if you must examine me, do so in the\r\n",
      "proper form! I will not allow you to do so otherwise, and so meanwhile,\r\n",
      "good-bye, as we have evidently nothing to keep us now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! What do you mean? What shall I question you about?”\r\n",
      " cackled Porfiry Petrovitch with a change of tone, instantly leaving off\r\n",
      "laughing. “Please don’t disturb yourself,” he began fidgeting from place\r\n",
      "to place and fussily making Raskolnikov sit down. “There’s no hurry,\r\n",
      "there’s no hurry, it’s all nonsense. Oh, no, I’m very glad you’ve come\r\n",
      "to see me at last... I look upon you simply as a visitor. And as for\r\n",
      "my confounded laughter, please excuse it, Rodion Romanovitch. Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch? That is your name?... It’s my nerves, you tickled me\r\n",
      "so with your witty observation; I assure you, sometimes I shake with\r\n",
      "laughter like an india-rubber ball for half an hour at a time.... I’m\r\n",
      "often afraid of an attack of paralysis. Do sit down. Please do, or I\r\n",
      "shall think you are angry...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov did not speak; he listened, watching him, still frowning\r\n",
      "angrily. He did sit down, but still held his cap.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must tell you one thing about myself, my dear Rodion Romanovitch,”\r\n",
      " Porfiry Petrovitch continued, moving about the room and again avoiding\r\n",
      "his visitor’s eyes. “You see, I’m a bachelor, a man of no consequence\r\n",
      "and not used to society; besides, I have nothing before me, I’m set, I’m\r\n",
      "running to seed and... and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in\r\n",
      "our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but\r\n",
      "respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before\r\n",
      "they can find a subject for conversation--they are dumb, they sit\r\n",
      "opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of\r\n",
      "conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have\r\n",
      "their subjects of conversation, _c’est de rigueur_, but people of the\r\n",
      "middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied\r\n",
      "and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public\r\n",
      "interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don’t want to deceive one\r\n",
      "another, I don’t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it\r\n",
      "looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so\r\n",
      "delighted...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov put down his cap and continued listening in silence with\r\n",
      "a serious frowning face to the vague and empty chatter of Porfiry\r\n",
      "Petrovitch. “Does he really want to distract my attention with his silly\r\n",
      "babble?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I can’t offer you coffee here; but why not spend five minutes with a\r\n",
      "friend?” Porfiry pattered on, “and you know all these official\r\n",
      "duties... please don’t mind my running up and down, excuse it, my dear\r\n",
      "fellow, I am very much afraid of offending you, but exercise is\r\n",
      "absolutely indispensable for me. I’m always sitting and so glad to be\r\n",
      "moving about for five minutes... I suffer from my sedentary life... I\r\n",

      "and all such formalities... you mentioned inquiries yourself just now...\r\n",
      "I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for\r\n",
      "the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation\r\n",
      "yourself just now very aptly and wittily.” (Raskolnikov had made no\r\n",
      "observation of the kind.) “One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One\r\n",
      "keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and\r\n",
      "we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for\r\n",
      "our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree\r\n",
      "with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that\r\n",
      "they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily\r\n",
      "put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!--your felicitous\r\n",
      "comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by ‘government\r\n",

      "by the way, yes! One word leads to another. You spoke of formality just\r\n",
      "now, apropos of the inquiry, you know. But what’s the use of formality?\r\n",
      "In many cases it’s nonsense. Sometimes one has a friendly chat and gets\r\n",
      "a good deal more out of it. One can always fall back on formality, allow\r\n",
      "me to assure you. And after all, what does it amount to? An examining\r\n",
      "lawyer cannot be bounded by formality at every step. The work of\r\n",

      "right hand behind his back, while with his left making gesticulations\r\n",

      "wittily at our legal forms, he-he! Some of these elaborate psychological\r\n",
      "methods are exceedingly ridiculous and perhaps useless, if one adheres\r\n",
      "too closely to the forms. Yes... I am talking of forms again. Well, if\r\n",
      "I recognise, or more strictly speaking, if I suspect someone or other to\r\n",

      "least. You’re laughing, you don’t believe me again? Of course, you’re\r\n",
      "right, too. You’re right, you’re right. These are special cases, I\r\n",

      "general case, the case for which all legal forms and rules are intended,\r\n",
      "for which they are calculated and laid down in books, does not exist at\r\n",
      "all, for the reason that every case, every crime, for instance, so soon\r\n",
      "as it actually occurs, at once becomes a thoroughly special case and\r\n",
      "sometimes a case unlike any that’s gone before. Very comic cases of that\r\n",
      "sort sometimes occur. If I leave one man quite alone, if I don’t touch\r\n",
      "him and don’t worry him, but let him know or at least suspect every\r\n",
      "moment that I know all about it and am watching him day and night, and\r\n",
      "if he is in continual suspicion and terror, he’ll be bound to lose his\r\n",
      "head. He’ll come of himself, or maybe do something which will make it as\r\n",
      "plain as twice two are four--it’s delightful. It may be so with a simple\r\n",
      "peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a\r\n",
      "certain side, it’s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it’s a very\r\n",

      "there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they\r\n",

      "And he braced himself to face a terrible and unknown ordeal. At times\r\n",
      "he longed to fall on Porfiry and strangle him. This anger was what he\r\n",
      "dreaded from the beginning. He felt that his parched lips were flecked\r\n",
      "with foam, his heart was throbbing. But he was still determined not to\r\n",
      "speak till the right moment. He realised that this was the best\r\n",
      "policy in his position, because instead of saying too much he would be\r\n",

      "at every instant and again pacing round the room. “And to be sure you’re\r\n",
      "right: God has given me a figure that can awaken none but comic ideas in\r\n",
      "other people; a buffoon; but let me tell you, and I repeat it, excuse\r\n",
      "an old man, my dear Rodion Romanovitch, you are a man still young, so to\r\n",
      "say, in your first youth and so you put intellect above everything, like\r\n",
      "all young people. Playful wit and abstract arguments fascinate you and\r\n",
      "that’s for all the world like the old Austrian _Hof-kriegsrath_, as\r\n",
      "far as I can judge of military matters, that is: on paper they’d beaten\r\n",
      "Napoleon and taken him prisoner, and there in their study they worked it\r\n",

      "with all his army, he-he-he! I see, I see, Rodion Romanovitch, you are\r\n",

      "But I can’t help it, it’s my weakness. I am fond of military science.\r\n",
      "And I’m ever so fond of reading all military histories. I’ve certainly\r\n",
      "missed my proper career. I ought to have been in the army, upon my\r\n",
      "word I ought. I shouldn’t have been a Napoleon, but I might have been a\r\n",
      "major, he-he! Well, I’ll tell you the whole truth, my dear fellow, about\r\n",
      "this _special case_, I mean: actual fact and a man’s temperament, my\r\n",
      "dear sir, are weighty matters and it’s astonishing how they sometimes\r\n",
      "deceive the sharpest calculation! I--listen to an old man--am speaking\r\n",
      "seriously, Rodion Romanovitch” (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who\r\n",
      "was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even\r\n",
      "his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) “Moreover, I’m\r\n",
      "a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I\r\n",
      "really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don’t even expect a\r\n",
      "reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid\r\n",
      "thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of\r\n",
      "life, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a\r\n",
      "poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he’s liable\r\n",
      "to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after\r\n",
      "all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal’s temperament, worse\r\n",
      "luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don’t think\r\n",
      "of that ‘when they overstep all obstacles,’ as you wittily and cleverly\r\n",
      "expressed it yesterday. He will lie--that is, the man who is a _special\r\n",
      "case_, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion;\r\n",
      "you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at\r\n",
      "the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint. Of course\r\n",
      "there may be illness and a stuffy room as well, but anyway! Anyway he’s\r\n",
      "given us the idea! He lied incomparably, but he didn’t reckon on his\r\n",
      "temperament. That’s what betrays him! Another time he will be carried\r\n",
      "away by his playful wit into making fun of the man who suspects him, he\r\n",
      "will turn pale as it were on purpose to mislead, but his paleness will\r\n",
      "be _too natural_, too much like the real thing, again he has given us\r\n",
      "an idea! Though his questioner may be deceived at first, he will think\r\n",
      "differently next day if he is not a fool, and, of course, it is like\r\n",
      "that at every step! He puts himself forward where he is not wanted,\r\n",
      "speaks continually when he ought to keep silent, brings in all sorts of\r\n",
      "allegorical allusions, he-he! Comes and asks why didn’t you take me long\r\n",
      "ago? he-he-he! And that can happen, you know, with the cleverest man,\r\n",
      "the psychologist, the literary man. The temperament reflects everything\r\n",
      "like a mirror! Gaze into it and admire what you see! But why are you so\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, don’t trouble, please,” cried Raskolnikov and he suddenly broke\r\n",
      "into a laugh. “Please don’t trouble.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry stood facing him, paused a moment and suddenly he too laughed.\r\n",

      "laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Porfiry Petrovitch,” he began, speaking loudly and distinctly, though\r\n",
      "his legs trembled and he could scarcely stand. “I see clearly at last\r\n",
      "that you actually suspect me of murdering that old woman and her sister\r\n",
      "Lizaveta. Let me tell you for my part that I am sick of this. If you\r\n",
      "find that you have a right to prosecute me legally, to arrest me, then\r\n",
      "prosecute me, arrest me. But I will not let myself be jeered at to my\r\n",

      "his voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t allow it!” he shouted, bringing his fist down on the table. “Do\r\n",
      "you hear that, Porfiry Petrovitch? I won’t allow it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! What does it mean?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, apparently\r\n",
      "quite frightened. “Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow, what is the\r\n",
      "matter with you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov shouted again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, my dear man! They’ll hear and come in. Just think, what could we\r\n",

      "close to Raskolnikov’s.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I won’t allow it, I won’t allow it,” Raskolnikov repeated mechanically,\r\n",
      "but he too spoke in a sudden whisper.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Some fresh air! And you must have some water, my dear fellow. You’re\r\n",
      "ill!” and he was running to the door to call for some when he found a\r\n",
      "decanter of water in the corner. “Come, drink a little,” he whispered,\r\n",
      "rushing up to him with the decanter. “It will be sure to do you good.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch’s alarm and sympathy were so natural that Raskolnikov\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He forced him to take the glass. Raskolnikov raised it mechanically to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, you’ve had a little attack! You’ll bring back your illness again,\r\n",
      "my dear fellow,” Porfiry Petrovitch cackled with friendly sympathy,\r\n",
      "though he still looked rather disconcerted. “Good heavens, you must\r\n",
      "take more care of yourself! Dmitri Prokofitch was here, came to see me\r\n",
      "yesterday--I know, I know, I’ve a nasty, ironical temper, but what they\r\n",
      "made of it!... Good heavens, he came yesterday after you’d been. We\r\n",
      "dined and he talked and talked away, and I could only throw up my hands\r\n",
      "in despair! Did he come from you? But do sit down, for mercy’s sake, sit\r\n",
      "down!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I knew. What of it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you;\r\n",
      "I know about everything. I know how you went _to take a flat_ at night\r\n",
      "when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so\r\n",
      "that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I\r\n",
      "understand your state of mind at that time... but you’ll drive yourself\r\n",
      "mad like that, upon my word! You’ll lose your head! You’re full of\r\n",
      "generous indignation at the wrongs you’ve received, first from destiny,\r\n",
      "and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to\r\n",
      "another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because\r\n",
      "you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness. That’s so, isn’t\r\n",
      "it? I have guessed how you feel, haven’t I? Only in that way you’ll\r\n",
      "lose your head and Razumihin’s, too; he’s too _good_ a man for such\r\n",
      "a position, you must know that. You are ill and he is good and your\r\n",
      "illness is infectious for him... I’ll tell you about it when you are\r\n",
      "more yourself.... But do sit down, for goodness’ sake. Please rest, you\r\n",
      "look shocking, do sit down.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat down; he no longer shivered, he was hot all over. In\r\n",
      "amazement he listened with strained attention to Porfiry Petrovitch who\r\n",
      "still seemed frightened as he looked after him with friendly solicitude.\r\n",
      "But he did not believe a word he said, though he felt a strange\r\n",
      "inclination to believe. Porfiry’s unexpected words about the flat had\r\n",
      "utterly overwhelmed him. “How can it be, he knows about the flat then,”\r\n",
      " he thought suddenly, “and he tells it me himself!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, in our legal practice there was a case almost exactly similar, a\r\n",
      "case of morbid psychology,” Porfiry went on quickly. “A man confessed to\r\n",
      "murder and how he kept it up! It was a regular hallucination; he brought\r\n",
      "forward facts, he imposed upon everyone and why? He had been partly, but\r\n",
      "only partly, unintentionally the cause of a murder and when he knew that\r\n",
      "he had given the murderers the opportunity, he sank into dejection, it\r\n",
      "got on his mind and turned his brain, he began imagining things and he\r\n",
      "persuaded himself that he was the murderer. But at last the High Court\r\n",
      "of Appeal went into it and the poor fellow was acquitted and put under\r\n",
      "proper care. Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear\r\n",
      "fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse\r\n",
      "to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about\r\n",
      "blood! I’ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man\r\n",
      "is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the\r\n",
      "same with bell-ringing.... It’s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You\r\n",
      "have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced\r\n",
      "doctor, what’s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You\r\n",
      "were delirious when you did all this!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is it possible, is it possible,” flashed through his mind, “that he is\r\n",
      "still lying? He can’t be, he can’t be.” He rejected that idea, feeling\r\n",
      "to what a degree of fury it might drive him, feeling that that fury\r\n",
      "might drive him mad.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was not delirious. I knew what I was doing,” he cried, straining\r\n",
      "every faculty to penetrate Porfiry’s game, “I was quite myself, do you\r\n",
      "hear?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I hear and understand. You said yesterday you were not delirious,\r\n",
      "you were particularly emphatic about it! I understand all you can tell\r\n",
      "me! A-ach!... Listen, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow. If you were\r\n",
      "actually a criminal, or were somehow mixed up in this damnable business,\r\n",
      "would you insist that you were not delirious but in full possession\r\n",
      "of your faculties? And so emphatically and persistently? Would it be\r\n",
      "possible? Quite impossible, to my thinking. If you had anything on\r\n",
      "your conscience, you certainly ought to insist that you were delirious.\r\n",
      "That’s so, isn’t it?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a note of slyness in this inquiry. Raskolnikov drew back on\r\n",
      "the sofa as Porfiry bent over him and stared in silent perplexity at\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Another thing about Razumihin--you certainly ought to have said that he\r\n",
      "came of his own accord, to have concealed your part in it! But you don’t\r\n",
      "conceal it! You lay stress on his coming at your instigation.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had not done so. A chill went down his back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You keep telling lies,” he said slowly and weakly, twisting his lips\r\n",
      "into a sickly smile, “you are trying again to show that you know all\r\n",
      "my game, that you know all I shall say beforehand,” he said, conscious\r\n",
      "himself that he was not weighing his words as he ought. “You want to\r\n",
      "frighten me... or you are simply laughing at me...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He still stared at him as he said this and again there was a light of\r\n",
      "intense hatred in his eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You keep lying,” he said. “You know perfectly well that the best\r\n",
      "policy for the criminal is to tell the truth as nearly as possible... to\r\n",
      "conceal as little as possible. I don’t believe you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What a wily person you are!” Porfiry tittered, “there’s no catching\r\n",
      "you; you’ve a perfect monomania. So you don’t believe me? But still you\r\n",
      "do believe me, you believe a quarter; I’ll soon make you believe the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I do,” went on Porfiry, touching Raskolnikov’s arm genially, “you\r\n",
      "must take care of your illness. Besides, your mother and sister are here\r\n",
      "now; you must think of them. You must soothe and comfort them and you do\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don’t\r\n",

      "Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No,\r\n",
      "you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your\r\n",
      "suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return\r\n",
      "to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a\r\n",
      "precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having),\r\n",
      "and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you,\r\n",
      "should I have acted like that? No, I should first have disarmed your\r\n",
      "suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted\r\n",
      "your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your\r\n",

      "nearly eleven at the murdered woman’s flat and why did you ring the bell\r\n",
      "and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters\r\n",
      "to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?’ That’s how\r\n",
      "I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to\r\n",
      "have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps\r\n",
      "have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have\r\n",
      "not done that! But you can’t look at it normally and you see nothing, I\r\n",
      "say again.”\r\n",

      "a good-humoured and ironical face, as though he were not in the least\r\n",
      "concerned at Raskolnikov’s opinion of him. “I am lying... but how did\r\n",

      "all right, but why, my good sir, in your illness and in your delirium\r\n",
      "were you haunted by just those delusions and not by any others? There\r\n",

      "kindly act in due form and don’t play with me! Don’t dare!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t worry about the form,” Porfiry interrupted with the same sly\r\n",
      "smile, as it were, gloating with enjoyment over Raskolnikov. “I invited\r\n",
      "you to see me quite in a friendly way.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t want your friendship and I spit on it! Do you hear? And, here,\r\n",
      "I take my cap and go. What will you say now if you mean to arrest me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took up his cap and went to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And won’t you see my little surprise?” chuckled Porfiry, again taking\r\n",
      "him by the arm and stopping him at the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to become more playful and good-humoured which maddened\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What surprise?” he asked, standing still and looking at Porfiry in\r\n",
      "alarm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My little surprise, it’s sitting there behind the door, he-he-he!”\r\n",
      " (He pointed to the locked door.) “I locked him in that he should not\r\n",
      "escape.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it? Where? What?...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked to the door and would have opened it, but it was\r\n",
      "locked.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s locked, here is the key!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he brought a key out of his pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are lying,” roared Raskolnikov without restraint, “you lie, you\r\n",
      "damned punchinello!” and he rushed at Porfiry who retreated to the other\r\n",
      "door, not at all alarmed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I understand it all! You are lying and mocking so that I may betray\r\n",
      "myself to you...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, you could not betray yourself any further, my dear Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch. You are in a passion. Don’t shout, I shall call the\r\n",
      "clerks.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are lying! Call the clerks! You knew I was ill and tried to work\r\n",
      "me into a frenzy to make me betray myself, that was your object! Produce\r\n",
      "your facts! I understand it all. You’ve no evidence, you have only\r\n",
      "wretched rubbishly suspicions like Zametov’s! You knew my character, you\r\n",
      "wanted to drive me to fury and then to knock me down with priests and\r\n",
      "deputies.... Are you waiting for them? eh! What are you waiting for?\r\n",
      "Where are they? Produce them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why deputies, my good man? What things people will imagine! And to do\r\n",
      "so would not be acting in form as you say, you don’t know the business,\r\n",
      "my dear fellow.... And there’s no escaping form, as you see,” Porfiry\r\n",
      "muttered, listening at the door through which a noise could be heard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, they’re coming,” cried Raskolnikov. “You’ve sent for them! You\r\n",
      "expected them! Well, produce them all: your deputies, your witnesses,\r\n",
      "what you like!... I am ready!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at this moment a strange incident occurred, something so unexpected\r\n",
      "that neither Raskolnikov nor Porfiry Petrovitch could have looked for\r\n",
      "such a conclusion to their interview.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CHAPTER VI\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he remembered the scene afterwards, this is how Raskolnikov saw it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The noise behind the door increased, and suddenly the door was opened a\r\n",
      "little.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, annoyed. “Why, I gave orders...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For an instant there was no answer, but it was evident that there were\r\n",
      "several persons at the door, and that they were apparently pushing\r\n",
      "somebody back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” Porfiry Petrovitch repeated, uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The prisoner Nikolay has been brought,” someone answered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He is not wanted! Take him away! Let him wait! What’s he doing here?\r\n",
      "How irregular!” cried Porfiry, rushing to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But he...” began the same voice, and suddenly ceased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two seconds, not more, were spent in actual struggle, then someone gave\r\n",
      "a violent shove, and then a man, very pale, strode into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This man’s appearance was at first sight very strange. He stared\r\n",
      "straight before him, as though seeing nothing. There was a determined\r\n",
      "gleam in his eyes; at the same time there was a deathly pallor in his\r\n",
      "face, as though he were being led to the scaffold. His white lips were\r\n",
      "faintly twitching.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was dressed like a workman and was of medium height, very young,\r\n",
      "slim, his hair cut in round crop, with thin spare features. The man whom\r\n",
      "he had thrust back followed him into the room and succeeded in seizing\r\n",
      "him by the shoulder; he was a warder; but Nikolay pulled his arm away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several persons crowded inquisitively into the doorway. Some of them\r\n",
      "tried to get in. All this took place almost instantaneously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go away, it’s too soon! Wait till you are sent for!... Why have you\r\n",
      "brought him so soon?” Porfiry Petrovitch muttered, extremely annoyed,\r\n",
      "and as it were thrown out of his reckoning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Nikolay suddenly knelt down.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter?” cried Porfiry, surprised.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am guilty! Mine is the sin! I am the murderer,” Nikolay articulated\r\n",
      "suddenly, rather breathless, but speaking fairly loudly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For ten seconds there was silence as though all had been struck dumb;\r\n",
      "even the warder stepped back, mechanically retreated to the door, and\r\n",
      "stood immovable.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Porfiry Petrovitch, recovering from his momentary\r\n",
      "stupefaction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I... am the murderer,” repeated Nikolay, after a brief pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What... you... what... whom did you kill?” Porfiry Petrovitch was\r\n",
      "obviously bewildered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nikolay again was silent for a moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Alyona Ivanovna and her sister Lizaveta Ivanovna, I... killed... with\r\n",
      "an axe. Darkness came over me,” he added suddenly, and was again silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some\r\n",
      "moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back\r\n",
      "the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door.\r\n",
      "Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner,\r\n",
      "staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short,\r\n",
      "looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and\r\n",
      "seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re in too great a hurry,” he shouted at him, almost angrily. “I\r\n",
      "didn’t ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,” Nikolay pronounced.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach! What did you kill them with?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“An axe. I had it ready.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, he is in a hurry! Alone?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nikolay did not understand the question.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Did you do it alone?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, alone. And Mitka is not guilty and had no share in it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t be in a hurry about Mitka! A-ach! How was it you ran downstairs\r\n",
      "like that at the time? The porters met you both!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was to put them off the scent... I ran after Mitka,” Nikolay replied\r\n",
      "hurriedly, as though he had prepared the answer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I knew it!” cried Porfiry, with vexation. “It’s not his own tale he is\r\n",
      "telling,” he muttered as though to himself, and suddenly his eyes rested\r\n",
      "on Raskolnikov again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was apparently so taken up with Nikolay that for a moment he had\r\n",
      "forgotten Raskolnikov. He was a little taken aback.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My dear Rodion Romanovitch, excuse me!” he flew up to him, “this won’t\r\n",
      "do; I’m afraid you must go... it’s no good your staying... I will...\r\n",
      "you see, what a surprise!... Good-bye!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And taking him by the arm, he showed him to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I suppose you didn’t expect it?” said Raskolnikov who, though he had\r\n",
      "not yet fully grasped the situation, had regained his courage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You did not expect it either, my friend. See how your hand is\r\n",
      "trembling! He-he!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re trembling, too, Porfiry Petrovitch!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, I am; I didn’t expect it.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were already at the door; Porfiry was impatient for Raskolnikov to\r\n",
      "be gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And your little surprise, aren’t you going to show it to me?”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov said, sarcastically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, his teeth are chattering as he asks, he-he! You are an ironical\r\n",
      "person! Come, till we meet!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I believe we can say _good-bye_!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s in God’s hands,” muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people\r\n",
      "were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from _the_ house,\r\n",
      "whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there\r\n",
      "waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of\r\n",
      "Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running\r\n",
      "after him, out of breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it’s in God’s hands,\r\n",
      "but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask\r\n",
      "you... so we shall meet again, shan’t we?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Porfiry stood still, facing him with a smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Shan’t we?” he added again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to want to say something more, but could not speak out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You must forgive me, Porfiry Petrovitch, for what has just passed... I\r\n",
      "lost my temper,” began Raskolnikov, who had so far regained his courage\r\n",
      "that he felt irresistibly inclined to display his coolness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t mention it, don’t mention it,” Porfiry replied, almost gleefully.\r\n",
      "“I myself, too... I have a wicked temper, I admit it! But we shall meet\r\n",
      "again. If it’s God’s will, we may see a great deal of one another.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And will get to know each other through and through?” added\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes; know each other through and through,” assented Porfiry Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "and he screwed up his eyes, looking earnestly at Raskolnikov. “Now\r\n",
      "you’re going to a birthday party?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To a funeral.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course, the funeral! Take care of yourself, and get well.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know what to wish you,” said Raskolnikov, who had begun to\r\n",
      "descend the stairs, but looked back again. “I should like to wish you\r\n",
      "success, but your office is such a comical one.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why comical?” Porfiry Petrovitch had turned to go, but he seemed to\r\n",
      "prick up his ears at this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, how you must have been torturing and harassing that poor Nikolay\r\n",
      "psychologically, after your fashion, till he confessed! You must have\r\n",
      "been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and\r\n",
      "now that he has confessed, you’ll begin vivisecting him again. ‘You are\r\n",
      "lying,’ you’ll say. ‘You are not the murderer! You can’t be! It’s not\r\n",
      "your own tale you are telling!’ You must admit it’s a comical business!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He-he-he! You noticed then that I said to Nikolay just now that it was\r\n",
      "not his own tale he was telling?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How could I help noticing it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He-he! You are quick-witted. You notice everything! You’ve really a\r\n",
      "playful mind! And you always fasten on the comic side... he-he! They say\r\n",
      "that was the marked characteristic of Gogol, among the writers.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, of Gogol.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, of Gogol.... I shall look forward to meeting you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So shall I.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked straight home. He was so muddled and bewildered that\r\n",
      "on getting home he sat for a quarter of an hour on the sofa, trying to\r\n",
      "collect his thoughts. He did not attempt to think about Nikolay; he\r\n",
      "was stupefied; he felt that his confession was something inexplicable,\r\n",
      "amazing--something beyond his understanding. But Nikolay’s confession\r\n",
      "was an actual fact. The consequences of this fact were clear to him at\r\n",
      "once, its falsehood could not fail to be discovered, and then they\r\n",
      "would be after him again. Till then, at least, he was free and must do\r\n",
      "something for himself, for the danger was imminent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But how imminent? His position gradually became clear to him.\r\n",
      "Remembering, sketchily, the main outlines of his recent scene with\r\n",
      "Porfiry, he could not help shuddering again with horror. Of course,\r\n",
      "he did not yet know all Porfiry’s aims, he could not see into all his\r\n",
      "calculations. But he had already partly shown his hand, and no one knew\r\n",
      "better than Raskolnikov how terrible Porfiry’s “lead” had been for\r\n",
      "him. A little more and he _might_ have given himself away completely,\r\n",
      "circumstantially. Knowing his nervous temperament and from the first\r\n",
      "glance seeing through him, Porfiry, though playing a bold game, was\r\n",
      "bound to win. There’s no denying that Raskolnikov had compromised\r\n",
      "himself seriously, but no _facts_ had come to light as yet; there was\r\n",
      "nothing positive. But was he taking a true view of the position? Wasn’t\r\n",
      "he mistaken? What had Porfiry been trying to get at? Had he really some\r\n",
      "surprise prepared for him? And what was it? Had he really been expecting\r\n",
      "something or not? How would they have parted if it had not been for the\r\n",
      "unexpected appearance of Nikolay?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Porfiry had shown almost all his cards--of course, he had risked\r\n",
      "something in showing them--and if he had really had anything up his\r\n",
      "sleeve (Raskolnikov reflected), he would have shown that, too. What was\r\n",
      "that “surprise”? Was it a joke? Had it meant anything? Could it have\r\n",
      "concealed anything like a fact, a piece of positive evidence? His\r\n",
      "yesterday’s visitor? What had become of him? Where was he to-day? If\r\n",
      "Porfiry really had any evidence, it must be connected with him....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat on the sofa with his elbows on his knees and his face hidden in\r\n",
      "his hands. He was still shivering nervously. At last he got up, took his\r\n",
      "cap, thought a minute, and went to the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had a sort of presentiment that for to-day, at least, he might\r\n",
      "consider himself out of danger. He had a sudden sense almost of joy; he\r\n",
      "wanted to make haste to Katerina Ivanovna’s. He would be too late for\r\n",
      "the funeral, of course, but he would be in time for the memorial dinner,\r\n",
      "and there at once he would see Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood still, thought a moment, and a suffering smile came for a\r\n",
      "moment on to his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“To-day! To-day,” he repeated to himself. “Yes, to-day! So it must\r\n",
      "be....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But as he was about to open the door, it began opening of itself. He\r\n",
      "started and moved back. The door opened gently and slowly, and there\r\n",
      "suddenly appeared a figure--yesterday’s visitor _from underground_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man stood in the doorway, looked at Raskolnikov without speaking,\r\n",
      "and took a step forward into the room. He was exactly the same as\r\n",
      "yesterday; the same figure, the same dress, but there was a great change\r\n",
      "in his face; he looked dejected and sighed deeply. If he had only put\r\n",
      "his hand up to his cheek and leaned his head on one side he would have\r\n",
      "looked exactly like a peasant woman.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want?” asked Raskolnikov, numb with terror. The man was\r\n",
      "still silent, but suddenly he bowed down almost to the ground, touching\r\n",
      "it with his finger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What is it?” cried Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I have sinned,” the man articulated softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“By evil thoughts.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They looked at one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was vexed. When you came, perhaps in drink, and bade the porters go\r\n",
      "to the police station and asked about the blood, I was vexed that they\r\n",
      "let you go and took you for drunken. I was so vexed that I lost my\r\n",
      "sleep. And remembering the address we came here yesterday and asked for\r\n",
      "you....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Who came?” Raskolnikov interrupted, instantly beginning to recollect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I did, I’ve wronged you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you come from that house?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was standing at the gate with them... don’t you remember? We have\r\n",
      "carried on our trade in that house for years past. We cure and prepare\r\n",
      "hides, we take work home... most of all I was vexed....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the whole scene of the day before yesterday in the gateway came\r\n",
      "clearly before Raskolnikov’s mind; he recollected that there had\r\n",
      "been several people there besides the porters, women among them.\r\n",
      "He remembered one voice had suggested taking him straight to the\r\n",
      "police-station. He could not recall the face of the speaker, and even\r\n",

      "The morning that followed the fateful interview with Dounia and\r\n",
      "her mother brought sobering influences to bear on Pyotr Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "Intensely unpleasant as it was, he was forced little by little to accept\r\n",
      "as a fact beyond recall what had seemed to him only the day before\r\n",
      "fantastic and incredible. The black snake of wounded vanity had been\r\n",
      "gnawing at his heart all night. When he got out of bed, Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "immediately looked in the looking-glass. He was afraid that he had\r\n",
      "jaundice. However his health seemed unimpaired so far, and looking at\r\n",
      "his noble, clear-skinned countenance which had grown fattish of\r\n",
      "late, Pyotr Petrovitch for an instant was positively comforted in the\r\n",
      "conviction that he would find another bride and, perhaps, even a better\r\n",
      "one. But coming back to the sense of his present position, he turned\r\n",
      "aside and spat vigorously, which excited a sarcastic smile in Andrey\r\n",
      "Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov, the young friend with whom he was staying.\r\n",
      "That smile Pyotr Petrovitch noticed, and at once set it down against his\r\n",
      "young friend’s account. He had set down a good many points against him\r\n",
      "of late. His anger was redoubled when he reflected that he ought not to\r\n",
      "have told Andrey Semyonovitch about the result of yesterday’s interview.\r\n",
      "That was the second mistake he had made in temper, through impulsiveness\r\n",
      "and irritability.... Moreover, all that morning one unpleasantness\r\n",
      "followed another. He even found a hitch awaiting him in his legal case\r\n",
      "in the senate. He was particularly irritated by the owner of the flat\r\n",
      "which had been taken in view of his approaching marriage and was being\r\n",
      "redecorated at his own expense; the owner, a rich German tradesman,\r\n",
      "would not entertain the idea of breaking the contract which had just\r\n",
      "been signed and insisted on the full forfeit money, though Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch would be giving him back the flat practically redecorated. In\r\n",
      "the same way the upholsterers refused to return a single rouble of the\r\n",
      "instalment paid for the furniture purchased but not yet removed to the\r\n",
      "flat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Am I to get married simply for the sake of the furniture?” Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch ground his teeth and at the same time once more he had a\r\n",
      "gleam of desperate hope. “Can all that be really so irrevocably over?\r\n",
      "Is it no use to make another effort?” The thought of Dounia sent a\r\n",
      "voluptuous pang through his heart. He endured anguish at that moment,\r\n",
      "and if it had been possible to slay Raskolnikov instantly by wishing it,\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch would promptly have uttered the wish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was my mistake, too, not to have given them money,” he thought, as\r\n",
      "he returned dejectedly to Lebeziatnikov’s room, “and why on earth was I\r\n",
      "such a Jew? It was false economy! I meant to keep them without a penny\r\n",
      "so that they should turn to me as their providence, and look at them!\r\n",
      "foo! If I’d spent some fifteen hundred roubles on them for the trousseau\r\n",
      "and presents, on knick-knacks, dressing-cases, jewellery, materials, and\r\n",
      "all that sort of trash from Knopp’s and the English shop, my position\r\n",
      "would have been better and... stronger! They could not have refused me\r\n",
      "so easily! They are the sort of people that would feel bound to return\r\n",
      "money and presents if they broke it off; and they would find it hard to\r\n",
      "do it! And their conscience would prick them: how can we dismiss a man\r\n",
      "who has hitherto been so generous and delicate?.... H’m! I’ve made a\r\n",
      "blunder.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And grinding his teeth again, Pyotr Petrovitch called himself a\r\n",
      "fool--but not aloud, of course.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He returned home, twice as irritated and angry as before. The\r\n",
      "preparations for the funeral dinner at Katerina Ivanovna’s excited\r\n",
      "his curiosity as he passed. He had heard about it the day before; he\r\n",
      "fancied, indeed, that he had been invited, but absorbed in his own cares\r\n",
      "he had paid no attention. Inquiring of Madame Lippevechsel who was busy\r\n",
      "laying the table while Katerina Ivanovna was away at the cemetery, he\r\n",
      "heard that the entertainment was to be a great affair, that all the\r\n",
      "lodgers had been invited, among them some who had not known the dead\r\n",
      "man, that even Andrey Semyonovitch Lebeziatnikov was invited in spite of\r\n",
      "his previous quarrel with Katerina Ivanovna, that he, Pyotr Petrovitch,\r\n",
      "was not only invited, but was eagerly expected as he was the most\r\n",
      "important of the lodgers. Amalia Ivanovna herself had been invited with\r\n",
      "great ceremony in spite of the recent unpleasantness, and so she was\r\n",
      "very busy with preparations and was taking a positive pleasure in them;\r\n",
      "she was moreover dressed up to the nines, all in new black silk, and she\r\n",
      "was proud of it. All this suggested an idea to Pyotr Petrovitch and he\r\n",
      "went into his room, or rather Lebeziatnikov’s, somewhat thoughtful. He\r\n",
      "had learnt that Raskolnikov was to be one of the guests.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Andrey Semyonovitch had been at home all the morning. The attitude of\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch to this gentleman was strange, though perhaps natural.\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch had despised and hated him from the day he came to stay\r\n",
      "with him and at the same time he seemed somewhat afraid of him. He\r\n",
      "had not come to stay with him on his arrival in Petersburg simply from\r\n",
      "parsimony, though that had been perhaps his chief object. He had heard\r\n",
      "of Andrey Semyonovitch, who had once been his ward, as a leading young\r\n",
      "progressive who was taking an important part in certain interesting\r\n",
      "circles, the doings of which were a legend in the provinces. It had\r\n",
      "impressed Pyotr Petrovitch. These powerful omniscient circles who\r\n",
      "despised everyone and showed everyone up had long inspired in him a\r\n",
      "peculiar but quite vague alarm. He had not, of course, been able to form\r\n",
      "even an approximate notion of what they meant. He, like everyone, had\r\n",
      "heard that there were, especially in Petersburg, progressives of some\r\n",
      "sort, nihilists and so on, and, like many people, he exaggerated and\r\n",
      "distorted the significance of those words to an absurd degree. What for\r\n",
      "many years past he had feared more than anything was _being shown\r\n",
      "up_ and this was the chief ground for his continual uneasiness at the\r\n",
      "thought of transferring his business to Petersburg. He was afraid of\r\n",
      "this as little children are sometimes panic-stricken. Some years before,\r\n",
      "when he was just entering on his own career, he had come upon two cases\r\n",
      "in which rather important personages in the province, patrons of his,\r\n",
      "had been cruelly shown up. One instance had ended in great scandal\r\n",
      "for the person attacked and the other had very nearly ended in serious\r\n",
      "trouble. For this reason Pyotr Petrovitch intended to go into the\r\n",
      "subject as soon as he reached Petersburg and, if necessary, to\r\n",
      "anticipate contingencies by seeking the favour of “our younger\r\n",
      "generation.” He relied on Andrey Semyonovitch for this and before\r\n",
      "his visit to Raskolnikov he had succeeded in picking up some current\r\n",
      "phrases. He soon discovered that Andrey Semyonovitch was a commonplace\r\n",
      "simpleton, but that by no means reassured Pyotr Petrovitch. Even if he\r\n",
      "had been certain that all the progressives were fools like him, it\r\n",
      "would not have allayed his uneasiness. All the doctrines, the ideas, the\r\n",
      "systems, with which Andrey Semyonovitch pestered him had no interest for\r\n",
      "him. He had his own object--he simply wanted to find out at once what\r\n",
      "was happening _here_. Had these people any power or not? Had he anything\r\n",
      "to fear from them? Would they expose any enterprise of his? And what\r\n",
      "precisely was now the object of their attacks? Could he somehow make up\r\n",
      "to them and get round them if they really were powerful? Was this the\r\n",
      "thing to do or not? Couldn’t he gain something through them? In fact\r\n",
      "hundreds of questions presented themselves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Andrey Semyonovitch was an anæmic, scrofulous little man, with strangely\r\n",
      "flaxen mutton-chop whiskers of which he was very proud. He was a clerk\r\n",
      "and had almost always something wrong with his eyes. He was rather\r\n",
      "soft-hearted, but self-confident and sometimes extremely conceited in\r\n",
      "speech, which had an absurd effect, incongruous with his little figure.\r\n",
      "He was one of the lodgers most respected by Amalia Ivanovna, for he did\r\n",
      "not get drunk and paid regularly for his lodgings. Andrey Semyonovitch\r\n",
      "really was rather stupid; he attached himself to the cause of progress\r\n",
      "and “our younger generation” from enthusiasm. He was one of the numerous\r\n",
      "and varied legion of dullards, of half-animate abortions, conceited,\r\n",
      "half-educated coxcombs, who attach themselves to the idea most in\r\n",
      "fashion only to vulgarise it and who caricature every cause they serve,\r\n",
      "however sincerely.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though Lebeziatnikov was so good-natured, he, too, was beginning to\r\n",
      "dislike Pyotr Petrovitch. This happened on both sides unconsciously.\r\n",
      "However simple Andrey Semyonovitch might be, he began to see that Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch was duping him and secretly despising him, and that “he was\r\n",
      "not the right sort of man.” He had tried expounding to him the system of\r\n",
      "Fourier and the Darwinian theory, but of late Pyotr Petrovitch began to\r\n",
      "listen too sarcastically and even to be rude. The fact was he had begun\r\n",
      "instinctively to guess that Lebeziatnikov was not merely a commonplace\r\n",
      "simpleton, but, perhaps, a liar, too, and that he had no connections of\r\n",
      "any consequence even in his own circle, but had simply picked things up\r\n",
      "third-hand; and that very likely he did not even know much about his own\r\n",
      "work of propaganda, for he was in too great a muddle. A fine person he\r\n",
      "would be to show anyone up! It must be noted, by the way, that Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch had during those ten days eagerly accepted the strangest\r\n",
      "praise from Andrey Semyonovitch; he had not protested, for instance,\r\n",
      "when Andrey Semyonovitch belauded him for being ready to contribute to\r\n",
      "the establishment of the new “commune,” or to abstain from christening\r\n",
      "his future children, or to acquiesce if Dounia were to take a lover a\r\n",
      "month after marriage, and so on. Pyotr Petrovitch so enjoyed hearing\r\n",

      "attributed to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch had had occasion that morning to realise some\r\n",
      "five-per-cent bonds and now he sat down to the table and counted over\r\n",
      "bundles of notes. Andrey Semyonovitch who hardly ever had any money\r\n",
      "walked about the room pretending to himself to look at all those bank\r\n",
      "notes with indifference and even contempt. Nothing would have convinced\r\n",

      "unmoved, and the latter, on his side, kept thinking bitterly that Pyotr\r\n",

      "reminding him of his inferiority and the great difference between them.\r\n",

      "out all my whiskers.... It’s permissable for anyone, I should hope,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "and returned to Katerina Ivanovna, overwhelmed with confusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All this time Lebeziatnikov had stood at the window or walked about the\r\n",
      "room, anxious not to interrupt the conversation; when Sonia had gone he\r\n",
      "walked up to Pyotr Petrovitch and solemnly held out his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "you did yesterday and who yet can sympathise with the misery of others,\r\n",
      "such a man... even though he is making a social mistake--is still\r\n",

      "like, but I am glad, positively glad it hasn’t come off, that you are\r\n",

      "question of first importance, I agree; but the question of children has\r\n",
      "another solution. Some refuse to have children altogether, because they\r\n",
      "suggest the institution of the family. We’ll speak of children later,\r\n",
      "but now as to the question of honour, I confess that’s my weak point.\r\n",

      "dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It’s nonsense,\r\n",
      "there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural\r\n",
      "consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest.\r\n",
      "So that indeed it’s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an\r\n",
      "absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of\r\n",
      "it. I should say to my wife: ‘My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now\r\n",
      "I respect you, for you’ve shown you can protest!’ You laugh! That’s\r\n",
      "because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound\r\n",
      "it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived\r\n",
      "in a legal marriage, but it’s simply a despicable consequence of a\r\n",
      "despicable position in which both are humiliated. When the deception is\r\n",
      "open, as in a free marriage, then it does not exist, it’s unthinkable.\r\n",
      "Your wife will only prove how she respects you by considering you\r\n",
      "incapable of opposing her happiness and avenging yourself on her for\r\n",
      "her new husband. Damn it all! I sometimes dream if I were to be married,\r\n",
      "pfoo! I mean if I were to marry, legally or not, it’s just the same,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the\r\n",
      "idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna’s disordered brain.\r\n",
      "Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov’s\r\n",
      "funeral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to\r\n",
      "honour the memory of the deceased “suitably,” that all the lodgers,\r\n",
      "and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know “that he was in no way their\r\n",
      "inferior, and perhaps very much their superior,” and that no one had the\r\n",
      "right “to turn up his nose at him.” Perhaps the chief element was that\r\n",
      "peculiar “poor man’s pride,” which compels many poor people to spend\r\n",
      "their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order\r\n",
      "to do “like other people,” and not to “be looked down upon.” It is very\r\n",
      "probable, too, that Katerina Ivanovna longed on this occasion, at\r\n",
      "the moment when she seemed to be abandoned by everyone, to show those\r\n",
      "“wretched contemptible lodgers” that she knew “how to do things, how\r\n",
      "to entertain” and that she had been brought up “in a genteel, she might\r\n",
      "almost say aristocratic colonel’s family” and had not been meant for\r\n",
      "sweeping floors and washing the children’s rags at night. Even the\r\n",
      "poorest and most broken-spirited people are sometimes liable to these\r\n",
      "paroxysms of pride and vanity which take the form of an irresistible\r\n",
      "nervous craving. And Katerina Ivanovna was not broken-spirited; she\r\n",
      "might have been killed by circumstance, but her spirit could not have\r\n",
      "been broken, that is, she could not have been intimidated, her will\r\n",
      "could not be crushed. Moreover Sonia had said with good reason that her\r\n",
      "mind was unhinged. She could not be said to be insane, but for a year\r\n",
      "past she had been so harassed that her mind might well be overstrained.\r\n",
      "The later stages of consumption are apt, doctors tell us, to affect the\r\n",
      "intellect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no great variety of wines, nor was there Madeira; but wine\r\n",
      "there was. There was vodka, rum and Lisbon wine, all of the poorest\r\n",
      "quality but in sufficient quantity. Besides the traditional rice and\r\n",
      "honey, there were three or four dishes, one of which consisted of\r\n",
      "pancakes, all prepared in Amalia Ivanovna’s kitchen. Two samovars were\r\n",
      "boiling, that tea and punch might be offered after dinner. Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna had herself seen to purchasing the provisions, with the help\r\n",
      "of one of the lodgers, an unfortunate little Pole who had somehow been\r\n",
      "stranded at Madame Lippevechsel’s. He promptly put himself at Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna’s disposal and had been all that morning and all the day before\r\n",
      "running about as fast as his legs could carry him, and very anxious\r\n",
      "that everyone should be aware of it. For every trifle he ran to Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, even hunting her out at the bazaar, at every instant called\r\n",
      "her “_Pani_.” She was heartily sick of him before the end, though\r\n",
      "she had declared at first that she could not have got on without this\r\n",
      "“serviceable and magnanimous man.” It was one of Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\n",
      "characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours.\r\n",
      "Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she\r\n",
      "would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance\r\n",
      "and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she\r\n",
      "would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the\r\n",
      "person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She\r\n",
      "was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from\r\n",
      "continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so _keenly_\r\n",
      "that all should live in peace and joy and should not _dare_ to break the\r\n",
      "peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost\r\n",
      "to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and\r\n",
      "fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against\r\n",
      "the wall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna, too, suddenly acquired extraordinary importance in\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna’s eyes and was treated by her with extraordinary\r\n",
      "respect, probably only because Amalia Ivanovna had thrown herself heart\r\n",
      "and soul into the preparations. She had undertaken to lay the table,\r\n",
      "to provide the linen, crockery, etc., and to cook the dishes in her\r\n",
      "kitchen, and Katerina Ivanovna had left it all in her hands and gone\r\n",
      "herself to the cemetery. Everything had been well done. Even the\r\n",
      "table-cloth was nearly clean; the crockery, knives, forks and glasses\r\n",
      "were, of course, of all shapes and patterns, lent by different lodgers,\r\n",
      "but the table was properly laid at the time fixed, and Amalia Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "feeling she had done her work well, had put on a black silk dress and\r\n",
      "a cap with new mourning ribbons and met the returning party with some\r\n",
      "pride. This pride, though justifiable, displeased Katerina Ivanovna for\r\n",
      "some reason: “as though the table could not have been laid except by\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna!” She disliked the cap with new ribbons, too. “Could she\r\n",
      "be stuck up, the stupid German, because she was mistress of the house,\r\n",
      "and had consented as a favour to help her poor lodgers! As a favour!\r\n",
      "Fancy that! Katerina Ivanovna’s father who had been a colonel and almost\r\n",
      "a governor had sometimes had the table set for forty persons, and then\r\n",
      "anyone like Amalia Ivanovna, or rather Ludwigovna, would not have been\r\n",
      "allowed into the kitchen.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna, however, put off expressing her feelings for the\r\n",

      "inwardly that she would certainly have to put Amalia Ivanovna down\r\n",
      "and set her in her proper place, for goodness only knew what she was\r\n",
      "fancying herself. Katerina Ivanovna was irritated too by the fact that\r\n",
      "hardly any of the lodgers invited had come to the funeral, except\r\n",
      "the Pole who had just managed to run into the cemetery, while to the\r\n",
      "memorial dinner the poorest and most insignificant of them had turned\r\n",
      "up, the wretched creatures, many of them not quite sober. The older\r\n",
      "and more respectable of them all, as if by common consent, stayed away.\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, for instance, who might be said to be the most\r\n",
      "respectable of all the lodgers, did not appear, though Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "had the evening before told all the world, that is Amalia Ivanovna,\r\n",
      "Polenka, Sonia and the Pole, that he was the most generous,\r\n",
      "noble-hearted man with a large property and vast connections, who had\r\n",
      "been a friend of her first husband’s, and a guest in her father’s\r\n",
      "house, and that he had promised to use all his influence to secure her\r\n",
      "a considerable pension. It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "exalted anyone’s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior\r\n",
      "motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to\r\n",
      "the consequence of the person praised. Probably “taking his cue” from\r\n",
      "Luzhin, “that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up\r\n",
      "either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness\r\n",

      "friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.”\r\n",

      "Among those who failed to appear were “the genteel lady and her\r\n",

      "last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar\r\n",
      "in Katerina Ivanovna’s room, especially when Marmeladov had come\r\n",
      "back drunk. Katerina Ivanovna heard this from Amalia Ivanovna who,\r\n",
      "quarrelling with Katerina Ivanovna, and threatening to turn the whole\r\n",
      "family out of doors, had shouted at her that they “were not worth the\r\n",

      "foot she was not worth,” and who had turned away haughtily when she\r\n",
      "casually met them, so that they might know that “she was more noble in\r\n",
      "her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,” and might see\r\n",
      "that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to\r\n",
      "make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father’s\r\n",
      "governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly\r\n",
      "stupid of them to turn away on meeting her. The fat colonel-major (he\r\n",
      "was really a discharged officer of low rank) was also absent, but it\r\n",
      "appeared that he had been “not himself” for the last two days. The party\r\n",
      "consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and\r\n",
      "a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt\r\n",
      "abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the\r\n",

      "appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought\r\n",
      "with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna’s\r\n",
      "and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna intensely. “For whom had they made all these preparations\r\n",
      "then?” To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid\r\n",
      "for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the\r\n",
      "furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big\r\n",

      "special severity, and loftily invited them to take their seats. Rushing\r\n",
      "to the conclusion that Amalia Ivanovna must be responsible for those who\r\n",
      "were absent, she began treating her with extreme nonchalance, which the\r\n",

      "knew, was in two years to take a professorship in the university,” and\r\n",
      "secondly because he immediately and respectfully apologised for having\r\n",
      "been unable to be at the funeral. She positively pounced upon him, and\r\n",

      "correctly and that everyone should taste them, in spite of the agonising\r\n",

      "absent-minded, though she kept looking at Katerina Ivanovna, trying\r\n",
      "to please her. Neither she nor Katerina Ivanovna had been able to get\r\n",

      "only dress, a dark striped cotton one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The message from Pyotr Petrovitch was very successful. Listening to\r\n",

      "Pyotr Petrovitch’s position and standing to find himself in such\r\n",
      "“extraordinary company,” in spite of his devotion to her family and his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“That’s why I am so grateful to you, Rodion Romanovitch, that you have\r\n",
      "not disdained my hospitality, even in such surroundings,” she added\r\n",
      "almost aloud. “But I am sure that it was only your special affection for\r\n",
      "my poor husband that has made you keep your promise.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then once more with pride and dignity she scanned her visitors, and\r\n",
      "suddenly inquired aloud across the table of the deaf man: “Wouldn’t he\r\n",
      "have some more meat, and had he been given some wine?” The old man made\r\n",
      "no answer and for a long while could not understand what he was asked,\r\n",
      "though his neighbours amused themselves by poking and shaking him. He\r\n",
      "simply gazed about him with his mouth open, which only increased the\r\n",
      "general mirth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What an imbecile! Look, look! Why was he brought? But as to Pyotr\r\n",

      "face she addressed Amalia Ivanovna so sharply and loudly that the latter\r\n",
      "was quite disconcerted, “not like your dressed up draggletails whom\r\n",
      "my father would not have taken as cooks into his kitchen, and my late\r\n",

      "“My late husband certainly had that weakness, and everyone knows\r\n",
      "it,” Katerina Ivanovna attacked him at once, “but he was a kind and\r\n",
      "honourable man, who loved and respected his family. The worst of it was\r\n",
      "his good nature made him trust all sorts of disreputable people, and he\r\n",
      "drank with fellows who were not worth the sole of his shoe. Would you\r\n",
      "believe it, Rodion Romanovitch, they found a gingerbread cock in his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“A cock? Did you say a cock?” shouted the commissariat clerk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna did not vouchsafe a reply. She sighed, lost in\r\n",
      "thought.\r\n",

      "“No doubt you think, like everyone, that I was too severe with him,” she\r\n",

      "respected me very much! He was a kind-hearted man! And how sorry I was\r\n",
      "for him sometimes! He would sit in a corner and look at me, I used to\r\n",
      "feel so sorry for him, I used to want to be kind to him and then would\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Some fools would be the better for a good drubbing, as well as having\r\n",
      "their hair pulled. I am not talking of my late husband now!” Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna snapped at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flush on her cheeks grew more and more marked, her chest heaved. In\r\n",
      "another minute she would have been ready to make a scene. Many of the\r\n",
      "visitors were sniggering, evidently delighted. They began poking the\r\n",
      "commissariat clerk and whispering something to him. They were evidently\r\n",
      "trying to egg him on.\r\n",

      "“Allow me to ask what are you alluding to,” began the clerk, “that is\r\n",

      "politeness, just tasting the food that Katerina Ivanovna was continually\r\n",
      "putting on his plate, to avoid hurting her feelings. He watched Sonia\r\n",
      "intently. But Sonia became more and more anxious and distressed; she,\r\n",
      "too, foresaw that the dinner would not end peaceably, and saw with\r\n",
      "terror Katerina Ivanovna’s growing irritation. She knew that she, Sonia,\r\n",
      "was the chief reason for the ‘genteel’ ladies’ contemptuous treatment of\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna’s invitation. She had heard from Amalia Ivanovna that\r\n",

      "passed Sonia, from the other end of the table, a plate with two hearts\r\n",
      "pierced with an arrow, cut out of black bread. Katerina Ivanovna flushed\r\n",
      "crimson and at once said aloud across the table that the man who sent it\r\n",
      "was “a drunken ass!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna was foreseeing something amiss, and at the same time\r\n",
      "deeply wounded by Katerina Ivanovna’s haughtiness, and to restore the\r\n",
      "good-humour of the company and raise herself in their esteem she began,\r\n",
      "apropos of nothing, telling a story about an acquaintance of hers “Karl\r\n",
      "from the chemist’s,” who was driving one night in a cab, and that “the\r\n",
      "cabman wanted him to kill, and Karl very much begged him not to kill,\r\n",
      "and wept and clasped hands, and frightened and from fear pierced his\r\n",
      "heart.” Though Katerina Ivanovna smiled, she observed at once that\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna ought not to tell anecdotes in Russian; the latter was\r\n",
      "still more offended, and she retorted that her “_Vater aus Berlin_ was a\r\n",
      "very important man, and always went with his hands in pockets.” Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna could not restrain herself and laughed so much that Amalia\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Listen to the owl!” Katerina Ivanovna whispered at once, her\r\n",
      "good-humour almost restored, “she meant to say he kept his hands in\r\n",
      "his pockets, but she said he put his hands in people’s pockets.\r\n",
      "(Cough-cough.) And have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that all these\r\n",
      "Petersburg foreigners, the Germans especially, are all stupider than\r\n",
      "we! Can you fancy anyone of us telling how ‘Karl from the chemist’s’\r\n",
      "‘pierced his heart from fear’ and that the idiot, instead of punishing\r\n",
      "the cabman, ‘clasped his hands and wept, and much begged.’ Ah, the fool!\r\n",
      "And you know she fancies it’s very touching and does not suspect how\r\n",
      "stupid she is! To my thinking that drunken commissariat clerk is a great\r\n",
      "deal cleverer, anyway one can see that he has addled his brains with\r\n",

      "Regaining her good-humour, Katerina Ivanovna began at once telling\r\n",

      "a school for the daughters of gentlemen in her native town T----.\r\n",
      "This was the first time she had spoken to him of the project, and she\r\n",
      "launched out into the most alluring details. It suddenly appeared that\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna had in her hands the very certificate of honour of\r\n",
      "which Marmeladov had spoken to Raskolnikov in the tavern, when he told\r\n",
      "him that Katerina Ivanovna, his wife, had danced the shawl dance\r\n",
      "before the governor and other great personages on leaving school. This\r\n",
      "certificate of honour was obviously intended now to prove Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna’s right to open a boarding-school; but she had armed herself\r\n",
      "with it chiefly with the object of overwhelming “those two stuck-up\r\n",
      "draggletails” if they came to the dinner, and proving incontestably\r\n",
      "that Katerina Ivanovna was of the most noble, “she might even say\r\n",
      "aristocratic family, a colonel’s daughter and was far superior to\r\n",
      "certain adventuresses who have been so much to the fore of late.” The\r\n",
      "certificate of honour immediately passed into the hands of the drunken\r\n",
      "guests, and Katerina Ivanovna did not try to retain it, for it actually\r\n",
      "contained the statement _en toutes lettres_, that her father was of the\r\n",
      "rank of a major, and also a companion of an order, so that she really\r\n",
      "was almost the daughter of a colonel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Warming up, Katerina Ivanovna proceeded to enlarge on the peaceful and\r\n",
      "happy life they would lead in T----, on the gymnasium teachers whom\r\n",
      "she would engage to give lessons in her boarding-school, one a most\r\n",
      "respectable old Frenchman, one Mangot, who had taught Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "herself in old days and was still living in T----, and would no doubt\r\n",
      "teach in her school on moderate terms. Next she spoke of Sonia who would\r\n",
      "go with her to T---- and help her in all her plans. At this someone at\r\n",
      "the further end of the table gave a sudden guffaw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though Katerina Ivanovna tried to appear to be disdainfully unaware of\r\n",
      "it, she raised her voice and began at once speaking with conviction of\r\n",
      "Sonia’s undoubted ability to assist her, of “her gentleness, patience,\r\n",
      "devotion, generosity and good education,” tapping Sonia on the cheek and\r\n",
      "kissing her warmly twice. Sonia flushed crimson, and Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "suddenly burst into tears, immediately observing that she was “nervous\r\n",
      "and silly, that she was too much upset, that it was time to finish, and\r\n",
      "as the dinner was over, it was time to hand round the tea.”\r\n",

      "At that moment, Amalia Ivanovna, deeply aggrieved at taking no part in\r\n",
      "the conversation, and not being listened to, made one last effort,\r\n",
      "and with secret misgivings ventured on an exceedingly deep and weighty\r\n",
      "observation, that “in the future boarding-school she would have to pay\r\n",
      "particular attention to _die Wäsche_, and that there certainly must be a\r\n",
      "good _dame_ to look after the linen, and secondly that the young ladies\r\n",
      "must not novels at night read.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "business of the laundry maid, and not of the directress of a high-class\r\n",
      "boarding-school to look after _die Wäsche_, and as for novel-reading,\r\n",
      "that was simply rudeness, and she begged her to be silent.” Amalia\r\n",

      "was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those\r\n",
      "ladies, but “those ladies had not come, because those ladies _are_\r\n",
      "ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.” Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge\r\n",
      "what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her\r\n",
      "“_Vater aus Berlin_ was a very, very important man, and both hands in\r\n",
      "pockets went, and always used to say: ‘Poof! poof!’” and she leapt\r\n",
      "up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her\r\n",
      "pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling “poof!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "But this was too much for Katerina Ivanovna, and she at once declared,\r\n",
      "so that all could hear, that Amalia Ivanovna probably never had a\r\n",
      "father, but was simply a drunken Petersburg Finn, and had certainly once\r\n",
      "been a cook and probably something worse. Amalia Ivanovna turned as red\r\n",
      "as a lobster and squealed that perhaps Katerina Ivanovna never had a\r\n",
      "father, “but she had a _Vater aus Berlin_ and that he wore a long coat\r\n",
      "and always said poof-poof-poof!”\r\n",

      "that her father was a colonel, while Amalia Ivanovna’s father--if she\r\n",
      "really had one--was probably some Finnish milkman, but that probably she\r\n",

      "Ivanovna rose from her chair, and with a stern and apparently calm voice\r\n",

      "shouting at the top of her voice, that she was mistress of the house and\r\n",
      "that Katerina Ivanovna should leave the lodgings that minute; then she\r\n",
      "rushed for some reason to collect the silver spoons from the table.\r\n",
      "There was a great outcry and uproar, the children began crying. Sonia\r\n",
      "ran to restrain Katerina Ivanovna, but when Amalia Ivanovna shouted\r\n",
      "something about “the yellow ticket,” Katerina Ivanovna pushed Sonia\r\n",
      "away, and rushed at the landlady to carry out her threat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that minute the door opened, and Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin appeared\r\n",

      "having enjoyed her father’s hospitality. Though she had invented it\r\n",
      "herself, she believed in it firmly by this time. She was struck too\r\n",
      "by the businesslike, dry and even contemptuous menacing tone of Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch. All the clamour gradually died away at his entrance. Not\r\n",
      "only was this “serious business man” strikingly incongruous with the\r\n",
      "rest of the party, but it was evident, too, that he had come upon some\r\n",
      "matter of consequence, that some exceptional cause must have brought him\r\n",
      "and that therefore something was going to happen. Raskolnikov, standing\r\n",
      "beside Sonia, moved aside to let him pass; Pyotr Petrovitch did not\r\n",

      "doorway; he did not come in, but stood still, listening with marked\r\n",
      "interest, almost wonder, and seemed for a time perplexed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Excuse me for possibly interrupting you, but it’s a matter of\r\n",
      "some importance,” Pyotr Petrovitch observed, addressing the company\r\n",

      "Lebeziatnikov. If in any way whatever you know and will tell us where\r\n",

      "blame yourself.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Complete silence reigned in the room. Even the crying children were\r\n",

      "witnesses, if false or even mistaken, I should myself in a certain sense\r\n",
      "be made responsible, I am aware of that. This morning I changed for\r\n",
      "my own purposes several five-per-cent securities for the sum of\r\n",
      "approximately three thousand roubles. The account is noted down in my\r\n",

      "for the benefit of your relative. Mr. Lebeziatnikov saw all this. Then\r\n",

      "total correct. You will admit that recollecting your embarrassment, your\r\n",
      "eagerness to get away and the fact that you kept your hands for some\r\n",
      "time on the table, and taking into consideration your social position\r\n",
      "and the habits associated with it, I was, so to say, with horror and\r\n",
      "positively against my will, _compelled_ to entertain a suspicion--a\r\n",

      "destitute relative, I present you with my donation of ten roubles and\r\n",
      "you, on the spot, repay me for all that with such an action. It is too\r\n",
      "bad! You need a lesson. Reflect! Moreover, like a true friend I beg\r\n",
      "you--and you could have no better friend at this moment--think what you\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What!” cried Katerina Ivanovna, suddenly realising the position, and\r\n",

      "money! Sonia a thief! Why, she’d give away her last penny!” and Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna broke into hysterical laughter. “Did you ever see such an\r\n",

      "that...” Luzhin muttered, “that ought to be before the police... though\r\n",

      "out. But from the right pocket a piece of paper flew out and describing\r\n",
      "a parabola in the air fell at Luzhin’s feet. Everyone saw it, several\r\n",
      "cried out. Pyotr Petrovitch stooped down, picked up the paper in two\r\n",
      "fingers, lifted it where all could see it and opened it. It was a\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "eyes fixed on Sonia, except for an occasional rapid glance at Luzhin.\r\n",
      "Sonia stood still, as though unconscious. She was hardly able to feel\r\n",
      "surprise. Suddenly the colour rushed to her cheeks; she uttered a cry\r\n",
      "and hid her face in her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, it wasn’t I! I didn’t take it! I know nothing about it,” she cried\r\n",
      "with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped\r\n",
      "her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the\r\n",
      "world.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia! Sonia! I don’t believe it! You see, I don’t believe it!” she\r\n",
      "cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her\r\n",
      "arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her\r\n",
      "hands and kissing them, too, “you took it! How stupid these people are!\r\n",
      "Oh dear! You are fools, fools,” she cried, addressing the whole room,\r\n",
      "“you don’t know, you don’t know what a heart she has, what a girl she\r\n",
      "is! She take it, she? She’d sell her last rag, she’d go barefoot to help\r\n",
      "you if you needed it, that’s what she is! She has the yellow passport\r\n",
      "because my children were starving, she sold herself for us! Ah, husband,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The wail of the poor, consumptive, helpless woman seemed to produce a\r\n",
      "great effect on her audience. The agonised, wasted, consumptive face,\r\n",
      "the parched blood-stained lips, the hoarse voice, the tears unrestrained\r\n",
      "as a child’s, the trustful, childish and yet despairing prayer for help\r\n",
      "were so piteous that everyone seemed to feel for her. Pyotr Petrovitch\r\n",
      "at any rate was at once moved to _compassion_.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Madam, madam, this incident does not reflect upon you!” he cried\r\n",
      "impressively, “no one would take upon himself to accuse you of being an\r\n",
      "instigator or even an accomplice in it, especially as you have proved\r\n",
      "her guilt by turning out her pockets, showing that you had no previous\r\n",
      "idea of it. I am most ready, most ready to show compassion, if poverty,\r\n",
      "so to speak, drove Sofya Semyonovna to it, but why did you refuse to\r\n",
      "confess, mademoiselle? Were you afraid of the disgrace? The first step?\r\n",
      "You lost your head, perhaps? One can quite understand it.... But how\r\n",
      "could you have lowered yourself to such an action? Gentlemen,” he\r\n",
      "addressed the whole company, “gentlemen! Compassionate and, so to say,\r\n",

      "of the personal insult lavished upon me! And may this disgrace be a\r\n",

      "carry the matter no further. Enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch stole a glance at Raskolnikov. Their eyes met, and the\r\n",
      "fire in Raskolnikov’s seemed ready to reduce him to ashes. Meanwhile\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna apparently heard nothing. She was kissing and hugging\r\n",
      "Sonia like a madwoman. The children, too, were embracing Sonia on\r\n",
      "all sides, and Polenka--though she did not fully understand what was\r\n",
      "wrong--was drowned in tears and shaking with sobs, as she hid her pretty\r\n",
      "little face, swollen with weeping, on Sonia’s shoulder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How vile!” a loud voice cried suddenly in the doorway.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch looked round quickly.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“And you dared to call me as witness?” he said, going up to Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you mean? What are you talking about?” muttered Luzhin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I mean that you... are a slanderer, that’s what my words mean!”\r\n",
      " Lebeziatnikov said hotly, looking sternly at him with his short-sighted\r\n",
      "eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was extremely angry. Raskolnikov gazed intently at him, as though\r\n",
      "seizing and weighing each word. Again there was a silence. Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch indeed seemed almost dumbfounded for the first moment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I’m in my mind, but you are a scoundrel! Ah, how vile! I have heard\r\n",
      "everything. I kept waiting on purpose to understand it, for I must own\r\n",
      "even now it is not quite logical.... What you have done it all for I\r\n",
      "can’t understand.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You may be a drunkard, perhaps, vile man, but I am not! I never touch\r\n",
      "vodka, for it’s against my convictions. Would you believe it, he, he\r\n",
      "himself, with his own hands gave Sofya Semyonovna that hundred-rouble\r\n",
      "note--I saw it, I was a witness, I’ll take my oath! He did it, he!”\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I saw it, I saw it,” Lebeziatnikov repeated, “and though it is against\r\n",
      "my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like\r\n",
      "before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only\r\n",
      "like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying\r\n",
      "good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with\r\n",
      "the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What lies!” he cried impudently, “why, how could you, standing by the\r\n",
      "window, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You\r\n",
      "are raving!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I didn’t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw\r\n",
      "it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from\r\n",
      "the window--that’s true--I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble\r\n",
      "note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles,\r\n",
      "you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I\r\n",
      "was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not\r\n",
      "forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand\r\n",
      "all the time. I didn’t think of it again until, when you were getting\r\n",
      "up, you changed it from your right hand to your left and nearly dropped\r\n",
      "it! I noticed it because the same idea struck me again, that you meant\r\n",
      "to do her a kindness without my seeing. You can fancy how I watched you\r\n",
      "and I saw how you succeeded in slipping it into her pocket. I saw it, I\r\n",
      "saw it, I’ll take my oath.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov was almost breathless. Exclamations arose on all hands\r\n",
      "chiefly expressive of wonder, but some were menacing in tone. They all\r\n",
      "crowded round Pyotr Petrovitch. Katerina Ivanovna flew to Lebeziatnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was mistaken in you! Protect her! You are the only one to take her\r\n",

      "noticed’--what does it amount to? So I gave it to her on the sly on\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“What for? That’s what I can’t understand, but that what I am telling\r\n",

      "infamous criminal man, I remember how, on account of it, a question\r\n",
      "occurred to me at once, just when I was thanking you and pressing\r\n",
      "your hand. What made you put it secretly in her pocket? Why you did it\r\n",
      "secretly, I mean? Could it be simply to conceal it from me, knowing that\r\n",
      "my convictions are opposed to yours and that I do not approve of private\r\n",
      "benevolence, which effects no radical cure? Well, I decided that you\r\n",
      "really were ashamed of giving such a large sum before me. Perhaps,\r\n",
      "too, I thought, he wants to give her a surprise, when she finds a whole\r\n",
      "hundred-rouble note in her pocket. (For I know, some benevolent people\r\n",
      "are very fond of decking out their charitable actions in that way.) Then\r\n",
      "the idea struck me, too, that you wanted to test her, to see whether,\r\n",
      "when she found it, she would come to thank you. Then, too, that you\r\n",
      "wanted to avoid thanks and that, as the saying is, your right hand\r\n",
      "should not know... something of that sort, in fact. I thought of so\r\n",
      "many possibilities that I put off considering it, but still thought it\r\n",
      "indelicate to show you that I knew your secret. But another idea struck\r\n",
      "me again that Sofya Semyonovna might easily lose the money before she\r\n",
      "noticed it, that was why I decided to come in here to call her out of\r\n",
      "the room and to tell her that you put a hundred roubles in her pocket.\r\n",

      "in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite\r\n",
      "exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit. But his speech\r\n",

      "“I can explain why he risked such an action, and if necessary, I, too,\r\n",
      "will swear to it,” Raskolnikov said at last in a firm voice, and he\r\n",
      "stepped forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He appeared to be firm and composed. Everyone felt clearly, from the\r\n",
      "very look of him that he really knew about it and that the mystery would\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Now I can explain it all to myself,” said Raskolnikov, addressing\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov. “From the very beginning of the business, I suspected\r\n",
      "that there was some scoundrelly intrigue at the bottom of it. I began\r\n",
      "to suspect it from some special circumstances known to me only, which\r\n",
      "I will explain at once to everyone: they account for everything. Your\r\n",
      "valuable evidence has finally made everything clear to me. I beg all,\r\n",
      "all to listen. This gentleman (he pointed to Luzhin) was recently\r\n",
      "engaged to be married to a young lady--my sister, Avdotya Romanovna\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. But coming to Petersburg he quarrelled with me, the day\r\n",
      "before yesterday, at our first meeting and I drove him out of my room--I\r\n",
      "have two witnesses to prove it. He is a very spiteful man.... The day\r\n",
      "before yesterday I did not know that he was staying here, in your room,\r\n",
      "and that consequently on the very day we quarrelled--the day before\r\n",
      "yesterday--he saw me give Katerina Ivanovna some money for the funeral,\r\n",
      "as a friend of the late Mr. Marmeladov. He at once wrote a note to\r\n",
      "my mother and informed her that I had given away all my money, not\r\n",
      "to Katerina Ivanovna but to Sofya Semyonovna, and referred in a most\r\n",
      "contemptible way to the... character of Sofya Semyonovna, that is,\r\n",
      "hinted at the character of my attitude to Sofya Semyonovna. All this you\r\n",
      "understand was with the object of dividing me from my mother and sister,\r\n",
      "by insinuating that I was squandering on unworthy objects the money\r\n",
      "which they had sent me and which was all they had. Yesterday evening,\r\n",
      "before my mother and sister and in his presence, I declared that I had\r\n",
      "given the money to Katerina Ivanovna for the funeral and not to Sofya\r\n",
      "Semyonovna and that I had no acquaintance with Sofya Semyonovna and had\r\n",
      "never seen her before, indeed. At the same time I added that he,\r\n",
      "Pyotr Petrovitch Luzhin, with all his virtues, was not worth Sofya\r\n",
      "Semyonovna’s little finger, though he spoke so ill of her. To his\r\n",
      "question--would I let Sofya Semyonovna sit down beside my sister, I\r\n",
      "answered that I had already done so that day. Irritated that my mother\r\n",
      "and sister were unwilling to quarrel with me at his insinuations, he\r\n",
      "gradually began being unpardonably rude to them. A final rupture took\r\n",
      "place and he was turned out of the house. All this happened yesterday\r\n",
      "evening. Now I beg your special attention: consider: if he had now\r\n",
      "succeeded in proving that Sofya Semyonovna was a thief, he would\r\n",
      "have shown to my mother and sister that he was almost right in his\r\n",
      "suspicions, that he had reason to be angry at my putting my sister on\r\n",
      "a level with Sofya Semyonovna, that, in attacking me, he was protecting\r\n",
      "and preserving the honour of my sister, his betrothed. In fact he might\r\n",
      "even, through all this, have been able to estrange me from my family,\r\n",
      "and no doubt he hoped to be restored to favour with them; to say nothing\r\n",
      "of revenging himself on me personally, for he has grounds for supposing\r\n",
      "that the honour and happiness of Sofya Semyonovna are very precious to\r\n",
      "me. That was what he was working for! That’s how I understand it. That’s\r\n",
      "the whole reason for it and there can be no other!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was like this, or somewhat like this, that Raskolnikov wound up his\r\n",
      "speech which was followed very attentively, though often interrupted by\r\n",
      "exclamations from his audience. But in spite of interruptions he spoke\r\n",
      "clearly, calmly, exactly, firmly. His decisive voice, his tone of\r\n",
      "conviction and his stern face made a great impression on everyone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, yes, that’s it,” Lebeziatnikov assented gleefully, “that must be\r\n",
      "it, for he asked me, as soon as Sofya Semyonovna came into our room,\r\n",
      "whether you were here, whether I had seen you among Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\n",
      "guests. He called me aside to the window and asked me in secret. It was\r\n",
      "essential for him that you should be here! That’s it, that’s it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Luzhin smiled contemptuously and did not speak. But he was very pale. He\r\n",
      "seemed to be deliberating on some means of escape. Perhaps he would have\r\n",
      "been glad to give up everything and get away, but at the moment this\r\n",
      "was scarcely possible. It would have implied admitting the truth of\r\n",
      "the accusations brought against him. Moreover, the company, which had\r\n",
      "already been excited by drink, was now too much stirred to allow it. The\r\n",
      "commissariat clerk, though indeed he had not grasped the whole position,\r\n",
      "was shouting louder than anyone and was making some suggestions very\r\n",
      "unpleasant to Luzhin. But not all those present were drunk; lodgers came\r\n",
      "in from all the rooms. The three Poles were tremendously excited\r\n",
      "and were continually shouting at him: “The _pan_ is a _lajdak_!” and\r\n",
      "muttering threats in Polish. Sonia had been listening with strained\r\n",
      "attention, though she too seemed unable to grasp it all; she seemed as\r\n",
      "though she had just returned to consciousness. She did not take her\r\n",
      "eyes off Raskolnikov, feeling that all her safety lay in him. Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna breathed hard and painfully and seemed fearfully exhausted.\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna stood looking more stupid than anyone, with her mouth\r\n",
      "wide open, unable to make out what had happened. She only saw that Pyotr\r\n",
      "Petrovitch had somehow come to grief.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was attempting to speak again, but they did not let him.\r\n",
      "Everyone was crowding round Luzhin with threats and shouts of abuse.\r\n",
      "But Pyotr Petrovitch was not intimidated. Seeing that his accusation of\r\n",
      "Sonia had completely failed, he had recourse to insolence:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Allow me, gentlemen, allow me! Don’t squeeze, let me pass!” he said,\r\n",
      "making his way through the crowd. “And no threats, if you please! I\r\n",
      "assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the\r\n",
      "contrary, you’ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing\r\n",
      "the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I\r\n",
      "shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and\r\n",
      "will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and\r\n",
      "atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are\r\n",
      "foolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and\r\n",
      "everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I’ve\r\n",
      "been taking, the way I’ve been expounding... all this fortnight!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I told you myself to-day that I was going, when you tried to keep me;\r\n",

      "He forced his way through. But the commissariat clerk was unwilling to\r\n",
      "let him off so easily: he picked up a glass from the table, brandished\r\n",
      "it in the air and flung it at Pyotr Petrovitch; but the glass flew\r\n",
      "straight at Amalia Ivanovna. She screamed, and the clerk, overbalancing,\r\n",
      "fell heavily under the table. Pyotr Petrovitch made his way to his room\r\n",
      "and half an hour later had left the house. Sonia, timid by nature, had\r\n",
      "felt before that day that she could be ill-treated more easily than\r\n",
      "anyone, and that she could be wronged with impunity. Yet till that\r\n",
      "moment she had fancied that she might escape misfortune by care,\r\n",
      "gentleness and submissiveness before everyone. Her disappointment was\r\n",
      "too great. She could, of course, bear with patience and almost without\r\n",
      "murmur anything, even this. But for the first minute she felt it too\r\n",
      "bitter. In spite of her triumph and her justification--when her first\r\n",
      "terror and stupefaction had passed and she could understand it all\r\n",
      "clearly--the feeling of her helplessness and of the wrong done to her\r\n",
      "made her heart throb with anguish and she was overcome with hysterical\r\n",
      "weeping. At last, unable to bear any more, she rushed out of the room\r\n",
      "and ran home, almost immediately after Luzhin’s departure. When amidst\r\n",
      "loud laughter the glass flew at Amalia Ivanovna, it was more than the\r\n",
      "landlady could endure. With a shriek she rushed like a fury at Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, considering her to blame for everything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Out of my lodgings! At once! Quick march!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And with these words she began snatching up everything she could lay\r\n",
      "her hands on that belonged to Katerina Ivanovna, and throwing it on the\r\n",
      "floor. Katerina Ivanovna, pale, almost fainting, and gasping for breath,\r\n",
      "jumped up from the bed where she had sunk in exhaustion and darted at\r\n",
      "Amalia Ivanovna. But the battle was too unequal: the landlady waved her\r\n",
      "away like a feather.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What! As though that godless calumny was not enough--this vile creature\r\n",
      "attacks me! What! On the day of my husband’s funeral I am turned out of\r\n",
      "my lodging! After eating my bread and salt she turns me into the street,\r\n",
      "with my orphans! Where am I to go?” wailed the poor woman, sobbing and\r\n",
      "gasping. “Good God!” she cried with flashing eyes, “is there no justice\r\n",
      "upon earth? Whom should you protect if not us orphans? We shall see!\r\n",
      "There is law and justice on earth, there is, I will find it! Wait a bit,\r\n",
      "godless creature! Polenka, stay with the children, I’ll come back. Wait\r\n",
      "for me, if you have to wait in the street. We will see whether there is\r\n",
      "justice on earth!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And throwing over her head that green shawl which Marmeladov had\r\n",
      "mentioned to Raskolnikov, Katerina Ivanovna squeezed her way through the\r\n",
      "disorderly and drunken crowd of lodgers who still filled the room, and,\r\n",
      "wailing and tearful, she ran into the street--with a vague intention\r\n",
      "of going at once somewhere to find justice. Polenka with the two little\r\n",
      "ones in her arms crouched, terrified, on the trunk in the corner of the\r\n",
      "room, where she waited trembling for her mother to come back. Amalia\r\n",
      "Ivanovna raged about the room, shrieking, lamenting and throwing\r\n",
      "everything she came across on the floor. The lodgers talked\r\n",
      "incoherently, some commented to the best of their ability on what had\r\n",
      "happened, others quarrelled and swore at one another, while others\r\n",
      "struck up a song....\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "CHAPTER IV\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had been a vigorous and active champion of Sonia against\r\n",
      "Luzhin, although he had such a load of horror and anguish in his own\r\n",
      "heart. But having gone through so much in the morning, he found a sort\r\n",
      "of relief in a change of sensations, apart from the strong personal\r\n",
      "feeling which impelled him to defend Sonia. He was agitated too,\r\n",
      "especially at some moments, by the thought of his approaching interview\r\n",
      "with Sonia: he _had_ to tell her who had killed Lizaveta. He knew the\r\n",
      "terrible suffering it would be to him and, as it were, brushed away the\r\n",
      "thought of it. So when he cried as he left Katerina Ivanovna’s, “Well,\r\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna, we shall see what you’ll say now!” he was still\r\n",
      "superficially excited, still vigorous and defiant from his triumph over\r\n",
      "Luzhin. But, strange to say, by the time he reached Sonia’s lodging, he\r\n",
      "felt a sudden impotence and fear. He stood still in hesitation at the\r\n",
      "door, asking himself the strange question: “Must he tell her who killed\r\n",
      "Lizaveta?” It was a strange question because he felt at the very time\r\n",
      "not only that he could not help telling her, but also that he could\r\n",
      "not put off the telling. He did not yet know why it must be so, he\r\n",
      "only _felt_ it, and the agonising sense of his impotence before\r\n",
      "the inevitable almost crushed him. To cut short his hesitation and\r\n",
      "suffering, he quickly opened the door and looked at Sonia from the\r\n",
      "doorway. She was sitting with her elbows on the table and her face in\r\n",
      "her hands, but seeing Raskolnikov she got up at once and came to meet\r\n",
      "him as though she were expecting him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What would have become of me but for you?” she said quickly, meeting\r\n",
      "him in the middle of the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Evidently she was in haste to say this to him. It was what she had been\r\n",
      "waiting for.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went to the table and sat down on the chair from which she\r\n",
      "had only just risen. She stood facing him, two steps away, just as she\r\n",
      "had done the day before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, Sonia?” he said, and felt that his voice was trembling, “it was\r\n",
      "all due to ‘your social position and the habits associated with it.’ Did\r\n",
      "you understand that just now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Her face showed her distress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Only don’t talk to me as you did yesterday,” she interrupted him.\r\n",
      "“Please don’t begin it. There is misery enough without that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She made haste to smile, afraid that he might not like the reproach.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was silly to come away from there. What is happening there now? I\r\n",
      "wanted to go back directly, but I kept thinking that... you would come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He told her that Amalia Ivanovna was turning them out of their lodging\r\n",
      "and that Katerina Ivanovna had run off somewhere “to seek justice.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“My God!” cried Sonia, “let’s go at once....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And she snatched up her cape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s everlastingly the same thing!” said Raskolnikov, irritably.\r\n",
      "“You’ve no thought except for them! Stay a little with me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But... Katerina Ivanovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You won’t lose Katerina Ivanovna, you may be sure, she’ll come to you\r\n",
      "herself since she has run out,” he added peevishly. “If she doesn’t find\r\n",
      "you here, you’ll be blamed for it....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia sat down in painful suspense. Raskolnikov was silent, gazing at\r\n",
      "the floor and deliberating.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This time Luzhin did not want to prosecute you,” he began, not looking\r\n",
      "at Sonia, “but if he had wanted to, if it had suited his plans, he would\r\n",
      "have sent you to prison if it had not been for Lebeziatnikov and me.\r\n",
      "Ah?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes,” she assented in a faint voice. “Yes,” she repeated, preoccupied\r\n",
      "and distressed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I might easily not have been there. And it was quite an accident\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov’s turning up.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia was silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And if you’d gone to prison, what then? Do you remember what I said\r\n",
      "yesterday?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again she did not answer. He waited.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I thought you would cry out again ‘don’t speak of it, leave off.’”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov gave a laugh, but rather a forced one. “What, silence\r\n",
      "again?” he asked a minute later. “We must talk about something, you\r\n",
      "know. It would be interesting for me to know how you would decide a\r\n",
      "certain ‘problem’ as Lebeziatnikov would say.” (He was beginning to lose\r\n",
      "the thread.) “No, really, I am serious. Imagine, Sonia, that you had\r\n",
      "known all Luzhin’s intentions beforehand. Known, that is, for a fact,\r\n",
      "that they would be the ruin of Katerina Ivanovna and the children and\r\n",
      "yourself thrown in--since you don’t count yourself for anything--Polenka\r\n",
      "too... for she’ll go the same way. Well, if suddenly it all depended on\r\n",
      "your decision whether he or they should go on living, that is whether\r\n",
      "Luzhin should go on living and doing wicked things, or Katerina Ivanovna\r\n",
      "should die? How would you decide which of them was to die? I ask you?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked uneasily at him. There was something peculiar in this\r\n",
      "hesitating question, which seemed approaching something in a roundabout\r\n",
      "way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I felt that you were going to ask some question like that,” she said,\r\n",
      "looking inquisitively at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I dare say you did. But how is it to be answered?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why do you ask about what could not happen?” said Sonia reluctantly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then it would be better for Luzhin to go on living and doing wicked\r\n",
      "things? You haven’t dared to decide even that!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But I can’t know the Divine Providence.... And why do you ask what\r\n",
      "can’t be answered? What’s the use of such foolish questions? How could\r\n",
      "it happen that it should depend on my decision--who has made me a judge\r\n",
      "to decide who is to live and who is not to live?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, if the Divine Providence is to be mixed up in it, there is no doing\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You’d better say straight out what you want!” Sonia cried in distress.\r\n",
      "“You are leading up to something again.... Can you have come simply to\r\n",
      "torture me?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She could not control herself and began crying bitterly. He looked at\r\n",
      "her in gloomy misery. Five minutes passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Of course you’re right, Sonia,” he said softly at last. He was suddenly\r\n",
      "changed. His tone of assumed arrogance and helpless defiance was gone.\r\n",
      "Even his voice was suddenly weak. “I told you yesterday that I was not\r\n",
      "coming to ask forgiveness and almost the first thing I’ve said is to ask\r\n",
      "forgiveness.... I said that about Luzhin and Providence for my own sake.\r\n",

      "his pale smile. He bowed his head and hid his face in his hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And suddenly a strange, surprising sensation of a sort of bitter hatred\r\n",
      "for Sonia passed through his heart. As it were wondering and frightened\r\n",
      "of this sensation, he raised his head and looked intently at her; but he\r\n",
      "met her uneasy and painfully anxious eyes fixed on him; there was\r\n",
      "love in them; his hatred vanished like a phantom. It was not the real\r\n",

      "_that_ minute had come.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hid his face in his hands again and bowed his head. Suddenly he\r\n",

      "He could not utter a word. This was not at all, not at all the way he\r\n",
      "had intended to “tell” and he did not understand what was happening to\r\n",
      "him now. She went up to him, softly, sat down on the bed beside him and\r\n",
      "waited, not taking her eyes off him. Her heart throbbed and sank. It\r\n",
      "was unendurable; he turned his deadly pale face to her. His lips worked,\r\n",
      "helplessly struggling to utter something. A pang of terror passed\r\n",
      "through Sonia’s heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the matter?” she repeated, drawing a little away from him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, Sonia, don’t be frightened.... It’s nonsense. It really is\r\n",
      "nonsense, if you think of it,” he muttered, like a man in delirium. “Why\r\n",
      "have I come to torture you?” he added suddenly, looking at her. “Why,\r\n",
      "really? I keep asking myself that question, Sonia....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had perhaps been asking himself that question a quarter of an hour\r\n",
      "before, but now he spoke helplessly, hardly knowing what he said and\r\n",
      "feeling a continual tremor all over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, how you are suffering!” she muttered in distress, looking intently\r\n",
      "at him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s all nonsense.... Listen, Sonia.” He suddenly smiled, a pale\r\n",
      "helpless smile for two seconds. “You remember what I meant to tell you\r\n",
      "yesterday?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia waited uneasily.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I said as I went away that perhaps I was saying good-bye for ever, but\r\n",
      "that if I came to-day I would tell you who... who killed Lizaveta.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She began trembling all over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, here I’ve come to tell you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you really meant it yesterday?” she whispered with difficulty.\r\n",
      "“How do you know?” she asked quickly, as though suddenly regaining her\r\n",
      "reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia’s face grew paler and paler, and she breathed painfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I know.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She paused a minute.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have they found him?” she asked timidly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then how do you know about _it_?” she asked again, hardly audibly and\r\n",
      "again after a minute’s pause.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned to her and looked very intently at her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Guess,” he said, with the same distorted helpless smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A shudder passed over her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you... why do you frighten me like this?” she said, smiling like a\r\n",
      "child.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I must be a great friend of _his_... since I know,” Raskolnikov went\r\n",
      "on, still gazing into her face, as though he could not turn his eyes\r\n",
      "away. “He... did not mean to kill that Lizaveta... he... killed her\r\n",
      "accidentally.... He meant to kill the old woman when she was alone and\r\n",
      "he went there... and then Lizaveta came in... he killed her too.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another awful moment passed. Both still gazed at one another.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You can’t guess, then?” he asked suddenly, feeling as though he were\r\n",
      "flinging himself down from a steeple.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no...” whispered Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take a good look.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as he had said this again, the same familiar sensation froze his\r\n",
      "heart. He looked at her and all at once seemed to see in her face the\r\n",
      "face of Lizaveta. He remembered clearly the expression in Lizaveta’s\r\n",
      "face, when he approached her with the axe and she stepped back to the\r\n",
      "wall, putting out her hand, with childish terror in her face, looking\r\n",
      "as little children do when they begin to be frightened of something,\r\n",
      "looking intently and uneasily at what frightens them, shrinking back and\r\n",
      "holding out their little hands on the point of crying. Almost the same\r\n",
      "thing happened now to Sonia. With the same helplessness and the same\r\n",
      "terror, she looked at him for a while and, suddenly putting out her left\r\n",
      "hand, pressed her fingers faintly against his breast and slowly began to\r\n",
      "get up from the bed, moving further from him and keeping her eyes fixed\r\n",
      "even more immovably on him. Her terror infected him. The same fear\r\n",
      "showed itself on his face. In the same way he stared at her and almost\r\n",
      "with the same _childish_ smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you guessed?” he whispered at last.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Good God!” broke in an awful wail from her bosom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sank helplessly on the bed with her face in the pillows, but a\r\n",
      "moment later she got up, moved quickly to him, seized both his hands\r\n",
      "and, gripping them tight in her thin fingers, began looking into his\r\n",
      "face again with the same intent stare. In this last desperate look she\r\n",
      "tried to look into him and catch some last hope. But there was no hope;\r\n",
      "there was no doubt remaining; it was all true! Later on, indeed, when\r\n",
      "she recalled that moment, she thought it strange and wondered why she\r\n",
      "had seen at once that there was no doubt. She could not have said, for\r\n",
      "instance, that she had foreseen something of the sort--and yet now, as\r\n",
      "soon as he told her, she suddenly fancied that she had really foreseen\r\n",
      "this very thing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Stop, Sonia, enough! don’t torture me,” he begged her miserably.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was not at all, not at all like this he had thought of telling her,\r\n",
      "but this is how it happened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She jumped up, seeming not to know what she was doing, and, wringing her\r\n",
      "hands, walked into the middle of the room; but quickly went back and sat\r\n",
      "down again beside him, her shoulder almost touching his. All of a sudden\r\n",
      "she started as though she had been stabbed, uttered a cry and fell on\r\n",
      "her knees before him, she did not know why.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What have you done--what have you done to yourself?” she said in\r\n",
      "despair, and, jumping up, she flung herself on his neck, threw her arms\r\n",
      "round him, and held him tightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov drew back and looked at her with a mournful smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are a strange girl, Sonia--you kiss me and hug me when I tell you\r\n",
      "about that.... You don’t think what you are doing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“There is no one--no one in the whole world now so unhappy as you!” she\r\n",
      "cried in a frenzy, not hearing what he said, and she suddenly broke into\r\n",
      "violent hysterical weeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A feeling long unfamiliar to him flooded his heart and softened it at\r\n",
      "once. He did not struggle against it. Two tears started into his eyes\r\n",
      "and hung on his eyelashes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then you won’t leave me, Sonia?” he said, looking at her almost with\r\n",
      "hope.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, never, nowhere!” cried Sonia. “I will follow you, I will follow\r\n",
      "you everywhere. Oh, my God! Oh, how miserable I am!... Why, why didn’t I\r\n",
      "know you before! Why didn’t you come before? Oh, dear!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here I have come.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, now! What’s to be done now?... Together, together!” she repeated\r\n",
      "as it were unconsciously, and she hugged him again. “I’ll follow you to\r\n",
      "Siberia!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He recoiled at this, and the same hostile, almost haughty smile came to\r\n",
      "his lips.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Perhaps I don’t want to go to Siberia yet, Sonia,” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia looked at him quickly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again after her first passionate, agonising sympathy for the unhappy man\r\n",
      "the terrible idea of the murder overwhelmed her. In his changed tone she\r\n",
      "seemed to hear the murderer speaking. She looked at him bewildered. She\r\n",
      "knew nothing as yet, why, how, with what object it had been. Now all\r\n",
      "these questions rushed at once into her mind. And again she could not\r\n",
      "believe it: “He, he is a murderer! Could it be true?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What’s the meaning of it? Where am I?” she said in complete\r\n",
      "bewilderment, as though still unable to recover herself. “How could you,\r\n",
      "you, a man like you.... How could you bring yourself to it?... What does\r\n",
      "it mean?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, well--to plunder. Leave off, Sonia,” he answered wearily, almost\r\n",
      "with vexation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia stood as though struck dumb, but suddenly she cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You were hungry! It was... to help your mother? Yes?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Sonia, no,” he muttered, turning away and hanging his head. “I was\r\n",
      "not so hungry.... I certainly did want to help my mother, but... that’s\r\n",
      "not the real thing either.... Don’t torture me, Sonia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia clasped her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Could it, could it all be true? Good God, what a truth! Who could\r\n",
      "believe it? And how could you give away your last farthing and yet\r\n",
      "rob and murder! Ah,” she cried suddenly, “that money you gave Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna... that money.... Can that money...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Sonia,” he broke in hurriedly, “that money was not it. Don’t worry\r\n",
      "yourself! That money my mother sent me and it came when I was ill, the\r\n",
      "day I gave it to you.... Razumihin saw it... he received it for me....\r\n",
      "That money was mine--my own.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia listened to him in bewilderment and did her utmost to comprehend.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And _that_ money.... I don’t even know really whether there was any\r\n",
      "money,” he added softly, as though reflecting. “I took a purse off her\r\n",
      "neck, made of chamois leather... a purse stuffed full of something...\r\n",
      "but I didn’t look in it; I suppose I hadn’t time.... And the\r\n",
      "things--chains and trinkets--I buried under a stone with the purse next\r\n",
      "morning in a yard off the V---- Prospect. They are all there now....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia strained every nerve to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then why... why, you said you did it to rob, but you took nothing?” she\r\n",
      "asked quickly, catching at a straw.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I don’t know.... I haven’t yet decided whether to take that money or\r\n",
      "not,” he said, musing again; and, seeming to wake up with a start, he\r\n",
      "gave a brief ironical smile. “Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The thought flashed through Sonia’s mind, wasn’t he mad? But she\r\n",
      "dismissed it at once. “No, it was something else.” She could make\r\n",
      "nothing of it, nothing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Do you know, Sonia,” he said suddenly with conviction, “let me tell\r\n",
      "you: if I’d simply killed because I was hungry,” laying stress on\r\n",
      "every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, “I should\r\n",
      "be _happy_ now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,” he\r\n",
      "cried a moment later with a sort of despair, “what would it matter to\r\n",
      "you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such\r\n",
      "a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I’ve come to you\r\n",
      "to-day?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Go where?” asked Sonia timidly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Not to steal and not to murder, don’t be anxious,” he smiled bitterly.\r\n",
      "“We are so different.... And you know, Sonia, it’s only now, only this\r\n",
      "moment that I understand _where_ I asked you to go with me yesterday!\r\n",
      "Yesterday when I said it I did not know where. I asked you for one\r\n",
      "thing, I came to you for one thing--not to leave me. You won’t leave me,\r\n",
      "Sonia?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She squeezed his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?” he cried a minute\r\n",
      "later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. “Here you expect\r\n",
      "an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see\r\n",
      "that. But what can I tell you? You won’t understand and will only suffer\r\n",
      "misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again.\r\n",
      "Why do you do it? Because I couldn’t bear my burden and have come to\r\n",
      "throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can\r\n",
      "you love such a mean wretch?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But aren’t you suffering, too?” cried Sonia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again a wave of the same feeling surged into his heart, and again for an\r\n",
      "instant softened it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Sonia, I have a bad heart, take note of that. It may explain a great\r\n",
      "deal. I have come because I am bad. There are men who wouldn’t have\r\n",
      "come. But I am a coward and... a mean wretch. But... never mind! That’s\r\n",
      "not the point. I must speak now, but I don’t know how to begin.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He paused and sank into thought.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ach, we are so different,” he cried again, “we are not alike. And why,\r\n",
      "why did I come? I shall never forgive myself that.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, no, it was a good thing you came,” cried Sonia. “It’s better I\r\n",
      "should know, far better!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at her with anguish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What if it were really that?” he said, as though reaching a conclusion.\r\n",
      "“Yes, that’s what it was! I wanted to become a Napoleon, that is why I\r\n",
      "killed her.... Do you understand now?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“N-no,” Sonia whispered naïvely and timidly. “Only speak, speak, I shall\r\n",
      "understand, I shall understand _in myself_!” she kept begging him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’ll understand? Very well, we shall see!” He paused and was for some\r\n",
      "time lost in meditation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It was like this: I asked myself one day this question--what if\r\n",
      "Napoleon, for instance, had happened to be in my place, and if he had\r\n",
      "not had Toulon nor Egypt nor the passage of Mont Blanc to begin his\r\n",
      "career with, but instead of all those picturesque and monumental things,\r\n",
      "there had simply been some ridiculous old hag, a pawnbroker, who had\r\n",
      "to be murdered too to get money from her trunk (for his career, you\r\n",
      "understand). Well, would he have brought himself to that if there had\r\n",
      "been no other means? Wouldn’t he have felt a pang at its being so far\r\n",
      "from monumental and... and sinful, too? Well, I must tell you that I\r\n",
      "worried myself fearfully over that ‘question’ so that I was awfully\r\n",
      "ashamed when I guessed at last (all of a sudden, somehow) that it would\r\n",
      "not have given him the least pang, that it would not even have struck\r\n",
      "him that it was not monumental... that he would not have seen that there\r\n",
      "was anything in it to pause over, and that, if he had had no other way,\r\n",
      "he would have strangled her in a minute without thinking about it!\r\n",
      "Well, I too... left off thinking about it... murdered her, following\r\n",
      "his example. And that’s exactly how it was! Do you think it funny? Yes,\r\n",
      "Sonia, the funniest thing of all is that perhaps that’s just how it\r\n",
      "was.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia did not think it at all funny.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You had better tell me straight out... without examples,” she begged,\r\n",
      "still more timidly and scarcely audibly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He turned to her, looked sadly at her and took her hands.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You are right again, Sonia. Of course that’s all nonsense, it’s almost\r\n",
      "all talk! You see, you know of course that my mother has scarcely\r\n",
      "anything, my sister happened to have a good education and was condemned\r\n",
      "to drudge as a governess. All their hopes were centered on me. I was a\r\n",
      "student, but I couldn’t keep myself at the university and was forced\r\n",
      "for a time to leave it. Even if I had lingered on like that, in ten\r\n",
      "or twelve years I might (with luck) hope to be some sort of teacher or\r\n",
      "clerk with a salary of a thousand roubles” (he repeated it as though it\r\n",
      "were a lesson) “and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief\r\n",
      "and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my\r\n",
      "sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it’s a hard\r\n",
      "thing to pass everything by all one’s life, to turn one’s back upon\r\n",
      "everything, to forget one’s mother and decorously accept the insults\r\n",
      "inflicted on one’s sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to\r\n",
      "burden oneself with others--wife and children--and to leave them again\r\n",
      "without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman’s\r\n",
      "money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother,\r\n",
      "to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving\r\n",
      "it--and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up\r\n",
      "a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence....\r\n",
      "Well... that’s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did\r\n",
      "wrong.... Well, that’s enough.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He struggled to the end of his speech in exhaustion and let his head\r\n",
      "sink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh, that’s not it, that’s not it,” Sonia cried in distress. “How could\r\n",
      "one... no, that’s not right, not right.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You see yourself that it’s not right. But I’ve spoken truly, it’s the\r\n",
      "truth.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“As though that could be the truth! Good God!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“A human being--a louse!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I too know it wasn’t a louse,” he answered, looking strangely at\r\n",
      "her. “But I am talking nonsense, Sonia,” he added. “I’ve been talking\r\n",
      "nonsense a long time.... That’s not it, you are right there. There were\r\n",
      "quite, quite other causes for it! I haven’t talked to anyone for so\r\n",
      "long, Sonia.... My head aches dreadfully now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His eyes shone with feverish brilliance. He was almost delirious; an\r\n",
      "uneasy smile strayed on his lips. His terrible exhaustion could be seen\r\n",

      "was growing dizzy. And he talked so strangely; it seemed somehow\r\n",
      "comprehensible, but yet... “But how, how! Good God!” And she wrung her\r\n",
      "hands in despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, Sonia, that’s not it,” he began again suddenly, raising his head,\r\n",
      "as though a new and sudden train of thought had struck and as it were\r\n",
      "roused him--“that’s not it! Better... imagine--yes, it’s certainly\r\n",
      "better--imagine that I am vain, envious, malicious, base, vindictive\r\n",
      "and... well, perhaps with a tendency to insanity. (Let’s have it all out\r\n",
      "at once! They’ve talked of madness already, I noticed.) I told you just\r\n",
      "now I could not keep myself at the university. But do you know that\r\n",
      "perhaps I might have done? My mother would have sent me what I needed\r\n",
      "for the fees and I could have earned enough for clothes, boots and food,\r\n",
      "no doubt. Lessons had turned up at half a rouble. Razumihin works! But I\r\n",
      "turned sulky and wouldn’t. (Yes, sulkiness, that’s the right word for\r\n",
      "it!) I sat in my room like a spider. You’ve been in my den, you’ve seen\r\n",
      "it.... And do you know, Sonia, that low ceilings and tiny rooms cramp\r\n",
      "the soul and the mind? Ah, how I hated that garret! And yet I wouldn’t\r\n",
      "go out of it! I wouldn’t on purpose! I didn’t go out for days together,\r\n",
      "and I wouldn’t work, I wouldn’t even eat, I just lay there doing\r\n",
      "nothing. If Nastasya brought me anything, I ate it, if she didn’t, I\r\n",
      "went all day without; I wouldn’t ask, on purpose, from sulkiness! At\r\n",
      "night I had no light, I lay in the dark and I wouldn’t earn money for\r\n",
      "candles. I ought to have studied, but I sold my books; and the dust lies\r\n",
      "an inch thick on the notebooks on my table. I preferred lying still and\r\n",
      "thinking. And I kept thinking.... And I had dreams all the time, strange\r\n",
      "dreams of all sorts, no need to describe! Only then I began to fancy\r\n",
      "that... No, that’s not it! Again I am telling you wrong! You see I kept\r\n",
      "asking myself then: why am I so stupid that if others are stupid--and I\r\n",
      "know they are--yet I won’t be wiser? Then I saw, Sonia, that if one\r\n",
      "waits for everyone to get wiser it will take too long.... Afterwards I\r\n",
      "understood that that would never come to pass, that men won’t change and\r\n",
      "that nobody can alter it and that it’s not worth wasting effort over it.\r\n",
      "Yes, that’s so. That’s the law of their nature, Sonia,... that’s so!...\r\n",
      "And I know now, Sonia, that whoever is strong in mind and spirit will\r\n",
      "have power over them. Anyone who is greatly daring is right in their\r\n",
      "eyes. He who despises most things will be a lawgiver among them and he\r\n",
      "who dares most of all will be most in the right! So it has been till now\r\n",
      "and so it will always be. A man must be blind not to see it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Though Raskolnikov looked at Sonia as he said this, he no longer cared\r\n",
      "whether she understood or not. The fever had complete hold of him; he\r\n",
      "was in a sort of gloomy ecstasy (he certainly had been too long without\r\n",
      "talking to anyone). Sonia felt that his gloomy creed had become his\r\n",
      "faith and code.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I divined then, Sonia,” he went on eagerly, “that power is only\r\n",
      "vouchsafed to the man who dares to stoop and pick it up. There is only\r\n",
      "one thing, one thing needful: one has only to dare! Then for the first\r\n",
      "time in my life an idea took shape in my mind which no one had ever\r\n",
      "thought of before me, no one! I saw clear as daylight how strange it is\r\n",
      "that not a single person living in this mad world has had the daring to\r\n",
      "go straight for it all and send it flying to the devil! I... I wanted\r\n",
      "_to have the daring_... and I killed her. I only wanted to have the\r\n",
      "daring, Sonia! That was the whole cause of it!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Oh hush, hush,” cried Sonia, clasping her hands. “You turned away from\r\n",
      "God and God has smitten you, has given you over to the devil!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Then Sonia, when I used to lie there in the dark and all this became\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Hush, Sonia! I am not laughing. I know myself that it was the devil\r\n",

      "over to myself, lying there in the dark.... I’ve argued it all over with\r\n",
      "myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how\r\n",
      "sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it\r\n",
      "and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don’t\r\n",
      "suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a\r\n",
      "wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn’t suppose that\r\n",
      "I didn’t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether\r\n",
      "I had the right to gain power--I certainly hadn’t the right--or that if\r\n",
      "I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn’t\r\n",
      "so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his\r\n",
      "goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days,\r\n",
      "wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly\r\n",
      "of course that I wasn’t Napoleon. I had to endure all the agony of that\r\n",
      "battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder\r\n",
      "without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn’t\r\n",
      "want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn’t to help my mother I did\r\n",
      "the murder--that’s nonsense--I didn’t do the murder to gain wealth and\r\n",
      "power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it;\r\n",
      "I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a\r\n",
      "benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in\r\n",
      "my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn’t have cared at that\r\n",
      "moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It\r\n",
      "was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all\r\n",
      "now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder\r\n",
      "again. I wanted to find out something else; it was something else led\r\n",
      "me on. I wanted to find out then and quickly whether I was a louse\r\n",
      "like everybody else or a man. Whether I can step over barriers or\r\n",
      "not, whether I dare stoop to pick up or not, whether I am a trembling\r\n",

      "since that I had not the right to take that path, because I am just such\r\n",

      "knocking; someone seemed to be hammering... He went to the window, rose\r\n",
      "on tiptoe and looked out into the yard for a long time with an air of\r\n",
      "absorbed attention. But the yard was empty and he could not see who was\r\n",
      "hammering. In the house on the left he saw some open windows; on the\r\n",
      "window-sills were pots of sickly-looking geraniums. Linen was hung out\r\n",
      "of the windows... He knew it all by heart. He turned away and sat down\r\n",

      "had done at Sonia; then she came in and sat down in the same place\r\n",
      "as yesterday, on the chair facing him. He looked silently and almost\r\n",
      "vacantly at her.\r\n",

      "stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that\r\n",
      "there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such\r\n",
      "horror. I don’t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must\r\n",

      "him uneasily, and went out troubled.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No, he was not cold to her. There was an instant (the very last one)\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He could not, of course, and would not consider how ill he was. But all\r\n",
      "this continual anxiety and agony of mind could not but affect him. And\r\n",
      "if he were not lying in high fever it was perhaps just because this\r\n",

      "of his faculties. But this artificial excitement could not last long.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He wandered aimlessly. The sun was setting. A special form of misery had\r\n",
      "begun to oppress him of late. There was nothing poignant, nothing acute\r\n",
      "about it; but there was a feeling of permanence, of eternity about it;\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "On the canal bank near the bridge and not two houses away from the one\r\n",
      "where Sonia lodged, there was a crowd of people, consisting principally\r\n",
      "of gutter children. The hoarse broken voice of Katerina Ivanovna could\r\n",
      "be heard from the bridge, and it certainly was a strange spectacle\r\n",
      "likely to attract a street crowd. Katerina Ivanovna in her old dress\r\n",
      "with the green shawl, wearing a torn straw hat, crushed in a hideous way\r\n",
      "on one side, was really frantic. She was exhausted and breathless. Her\r\n",
      "wasted consumptive face looked more suffering than ever, and indeed out\r\n",
      "of doors in the sunshine a consumptive always looks worse than at home.\r\n",
      "But her excitement did not flag, and every moment her irritation grew\r\n",
      "more intense. She rushed at the children, shouted at them, coaxed\r\n",
      "them, told them before the crowd how to dance and what to sing, began\r\n",
      "explaining to them why it was necessary, and driven to desperation by\r\n",
      "their not understanding, beat them.... Then she would make a rush at the\r\n",
      "crowd; if she noticed any decently dressed person stopping to look, she\r\n",
      "immediately appealed to him to see what these children “from a genteel,\r\n",
      "one may say aristocratic, house” had been brought to. If she heard\r\n",
      "laughter or jeering in the crowd, she would rush at once at the scoffers\r\n",
      "and begin squabbling with them. Some people laughed, others shook their\r\n",
      "heads, but everyone felt curious at the sight of the madwoman with the\r\n",
      "frightened children. The frying-pan of which Lebeziatnikov had spoken\r\n",
      "was not there, at least Raskolnikov did not see it. But instead of\r\n",
      "rapping on the pan, Katerina Ivanovna began clapping her wasted hands,\r\n",
      "when she made Lida and Kolya dance and Polenka sing. She too joined in\r\n",
      "the singing, but broke down at the second note with a fearful cough,\r\n",
      "which made her curse in despair and even shed tears. What made her most\r\n",
      "furious was the weeping and terror of Kolya and Lida. Some effort had\r\n",
      "been made to dress the children up as street singers are dressed. The\r\n",
      "boy had on a turban made of something red and white to look like a Turk.\r\n",
      "There had been no costume for Lida; she simply had a red knitted cap,\r\n",
      "or rather a night cap that had belonged to Marmeladov, decorated with\r\n",
      "a broken piece of white ostrich feather, which had been Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna’s grandmother’s and had been preserved as a family possession.\r\n",
      "Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her\r\n",
      "mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her\r\n",
      "mother’s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly\r\n",
      "frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Leave off, Sonia, leave off,” she shouted, speaking fast, panting and\r\n",
      "coughing. “You don’t know what you ask; you are like a child! I’ve\r\n",
      "told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German. Let\r\n",
      "everyone, let all Petersburg see the children begging in the streets,\r\n",
      "though their father was an honourable man who served all his life in\r\n",
      "truth and fidelity, and one may say died in the service.” (Katerina\r\n",
      "Ivanovna had by now invented this fantastic story and thoroughly\r\n",
      "believed it.) “Let that wretch of a general see it! And you are silly,\r\n",
      "Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I\r\n",
      "won’t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?” she cried, seeing\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. “Explain to this silly girl, please,\r\n",

      "living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are\r\n",
      "an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary. And that general\r\n",
      "will lose his post, you’ll see! We shall perform under his windows every\r\n",
      "day, and if the Tsar drives by, I’ll fall on my knees, put the children\r\n",
      "before me, show them to him, and say ‘Defend us father.’ He is the\r\n",
      "father of the fatherless, he is merciful, he’ll protect us, you’ll\r\n",

      "that it was unseemly for her to be wandering about the streets like\r\n",
      "an organ-grinder, as she was intending to become the principal of a\r\n",
      "boarding-school.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“A boarding-school, ha-ha-ha! A castle in the air,” cried Katerina\r\n",

      "have you thought of anything, Polenka? If only you’d help your mother!\r\n",
      "My memory’s quite gone, or I should have thought of something. We really\r\n",

      "see at once that you are children of good family, and that will be much\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“Lord have mercy upon us,” said a woman, crossing herself. “Have they\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "When they examined Katerina Ivanovna carefully, they saw that she had\r\n",
      "not cut herself against a stone, as Sonia thought, but that the blood\r\n",
      "that stained the pavement red was from her chest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve seen that before,” muttered the official to Raskolnikov and\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov; “that’s consumption; the blood flows and chokes the\r\n",

      "nearly a pint of blood, all in a minute.... What’s to be done though?\r\n",

      "from one to the other. “Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thanks to the official’s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman\r\n",
      "even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia’s\r\n",
      "room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still\r\n",
      "flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov,\r\n",
      "Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were\r\n",
      "followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed\r\n",
      "to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who\r\n",
      "were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the\r\n",
      "Kapernaumovs’ room; the landlord, a lame one-eyed man of strange\r\n",
      "appearance with whiskers and hair that stood up like a brush, his\r\n",
      "wife, a woman with an everlastingly scared expression, and several\r\n",
      "open-mouthed children with wonder-struck faces. Among these,\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov suddenly made his appearance. Raskolnikov looked at him\r\n",
      "with surprise, not understanding where he had come from and not having\r\n",
      "noticed him in the crowd. A doctor and priest wore spoken of. The\r\n",
      "official whispered to Raskolnikov that he thought it was too late now\r\n",
      "for the doctor, but he ordered him to be sent for. Kapernaumov ran\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile Katerina Ivanovna had regained her breath. The bleeding ceased\r\n",
      "for a time. She looked with sick but intent and penetrating eyes at\r\n",
      "Sonia, who stood pale and trembling, wiping the sweat from her brow with\r\n",
      "a handkerchief. At last she asked to be raised. They sat her up on the\r\n",
      "bed, supporting her on both sides.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Where are the children?” she said in a faint voice. “You’ve brought\r\n",
      "them, Polenka? Oh the sillies! Why did you run away.... Och!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Once more her parched lips were covered with blood. She moved her eyes,\r\n",
      "looking about her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“So that’s how you live, Sonia! Never once have I been in your room.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "here they are, Sonia, take them all! I hand them over to you, I’ve had\r\n",
      "enough! The ball is over.” (Cough!) “Lay me down, let me die in peace.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They laid her back on the pillow.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What, the priest? I don’t want him. You haven’t got a rouble to spare.\r\n",
      "I have no sins. God must forgive me without that. He knows how I have\r\n",
      "suffered.... And if He won’t forgive me, I don’t care!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She sank more and more into uneasy delirium. At times she shuddered,\r\n",
      "turned her eyes from side to side, recognised everyone for a minute,\r\n",
      "but at once sank into delirium again. Her breathing was hoarse and\r\n",
      "difficult, there was a sort of rattle in her throat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I said to him, your excellency,” she ejaculated, gasping after each\r\n",

      "consciousness, and gazed at all with a sort of terror, but at once\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She sank into unconsciousness again, but this time it did not last long.\r\n",
      "Her pale, yellow, wasted face dropped back, her mouth fell open, her leg\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sonia fell upon her, flung her arms about her, and remained motionless\r\n",
      "with her head pressed to the dead woman’s wasted bosom. Polenka threw\r\n",
      "herself at her mother’s feet, kissing them and weeping violently. Though\r\n",
      "Kolya and Lida did not understand what had happened, they had a feeling\r\n",
      "that it was something terrible; they put their hands on each other’s\r\n",
      "little shoulders, stared straight at one another and both at once opened\r\n",
      "their mouths and began screaming. They were both still in their fancy\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He walked away to the window. Lebeziatnikov skipped up to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She is dead,” he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "need of that money. Won’t you admit that it’s simply done from humanity?\r\n",
      "She wasn’t ‘a louse,’ you know” (he pointed to the corner where the\r\n",
      "dead woman lay), “was she, like some old pawnbroker woman? Come, you’ll\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "A strange period began for Raskolnikov: it was as though a fog had\r\n",
      "fallen upon him and wrapped him in a dreary solitude from which there\r\n",
      "was no escape. Recalling that period long after, he believed that his\r\n",
      "mind had been clouded at times, and that it had continued so, with\r\n",
      "intervals, till the final catastrophe. He was convinced that he had been\r\n",
      "mistaken about many things at that time, for instance as to the date\r\n",
      "of certain events. Anyway, when he tried later on to piece his\r\n",
      "recollections together, he learnt a great deal about himself from what\r\n",
      "other people told him. He had mixed up incidents and had explained\r\n",
      "events as due to circumstances which existed only in his imagination. At\r\n",
      "times he was a prey to agonies of morbid uneasiness, amounting sometimes\r\n",
      "to panic. But he remembered, too, moments, hours, perhaps whole days,\r\n",
      "of complete apathy, which came upon him as a reaction from his previous\r\n",
      "terror and might be compared with the abnormal insensibility, sometimes\r\n",
      "seen in the dying. He seemed to be trying in that latter stage to escape\r\n",
      "from a full and clear understanding of his position. Certain essential\r\n",
      "facts which required immediate consideration were particularly irksome\r\n",
      "to him. How glad he would have been to be free from some cares, the\r\n",
      "neglect of which would have threatened him with complete, inevitable\r\n",
      "ruin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was particularly worried about Svidrigaïlov, he might be said to be\r\n",
      "permanently thinking of Svidrigaïlov. From the time of Svidrigaïlov’s\r\n",
      "too menacing and unmistakable words in Sonia’s room at the moment of\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna’s death, the normal working of his mind seemed to\r\n",
      "break down. But although this new fact caused him extreme uneasiness,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was in no hurry for an explanation of it. At times, finding\r\n",
      "himself in a solitary and remote part of the town, in some wretched\r\n",
      "eating-house, sitting alone lost in thought, hardly knowing how he had\r\n",
      "come there, he suddenly thought of Svidrigaïlov. He recognised\r\n",
      "suddenly, clearly, and with dismay that he ought at once to come to an\r\n",
      "understanding with that man and to make what terms he could. Walking\r\n",
      "outside the city gates one day, he positively fancied that they had\r\n",
      "fixed a meeting there, that he was waiting for Svidrigaïlov. Another\r\n",
      "time he woke up before daybreak lying on the ground under some bushes\r\n",
      "and could not at first understand how he had come there.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But during the two or three days after Katerina Ivanovna’s death, he\r\n",
      "had two or three times met Svidrigaïlov at Sonia’s lodging, where he\r\n",
      "had gone aimlessly for a moment. They exchanged a few words and made no\r\n",
      "reference to the vital subject, as though they were tacitly agreed not\r\n",
      "to speak of it for a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katerina Ivanovna’s body was still lying in the coffin, Svidrigaïlov was\r\n",
      "busy making arrangements for the funeral. Sonia too was very busy. At\r\n",
      "their last meeting Svidrigaïlov informed Raskolnikov that he had made\r\n",
      "an arrangement, and a very satisfactory one, for Katerina Ivanovna’s\r\n",
      "children; that he had, through certain connections, succeeded in getting\r\n",
      "hold of certain personages by whose help the three orphans could be at\r\n",
      "once placed in very suitable institutions; that the money he had settled\r\n",
      "on them had been of great assistance, as it is much easier to place\r\n",
      "orphans with some property than destitute ones. He said something\r\n",
      "too about Sonia and promised to come himself in a day or two to see\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov, mentioning that “he would like to consult with him, that\r\n",
      "there were things they must talk over....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This conversation took place in the passage on the stairs. Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "looked intently at Raskolnikov and suddenly, after a brief pause,\r\n",
      "dropping his voice, asked: “But how is it, Rodion Romanovitch; you\r\n",
      "don’t seem yourself? You look and you listen, but you don’t seem to\r\n",
      "understand. Cheer up! We’ll talk things over; I am only sorry, I’ve\r\n",
      "so much to do of my own business and other people’s. Ah, Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch,” he added suddenly, “what all men need is fresh air, fresh\r\n",
      "air... more than anything!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved to one side to make way for the priest and server, who\r\n",
      "were coming up the stairs. They had come for the requiem service. By\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov’s orders it was sung twice a day punctually. Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "went his way. Raskolnikov stood still a moment, thought, and followed\r\n",
      "the priest into Sonia’s room. He stood at the door. They began quietly,\r\n",
      "slowly and mournfully singing the service. From his childhood the\r\n",
      "thought of death and the presence of death had something oppressive\r\n",
      "and mysteriously awful; and it was long since he had heard the requiem\r\n",
      "service. And there was something else here as well, too awful and\r\n",
      "disturbing. He looked at the children: they were all kneeling by the\r\n",
      "coffin; Polenka was weeping. Behind them Sonia prayed, softly and, as it\r\n",
      "were, timidly weeping.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“These last two days she hasn’t said a word to me, she hasn’t glanced at\r\n",
      "me,” Raskolnikov thought suddenly. The sunlight was bright in the room;\r\n",
      "the incense rose in clouds; the priest read, “Give rest, oh Lord....”\r\n",
      " Raskolnikov stayed all through the service. As he blessed them and\r\n",
      "took his leave, the priest looked round strangely. After the service,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov went up to Sonia. She took both his hands and let her\r\n",
      "head sink on his shoulder. This slight friendly gesture bewildered\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov. It seemed strange to him that there was no trace of\r\n",
      "repugnance, no trace of disgust, no tremor in her hand. It was the\r\n",
      "furthest limit of self-abnegation, at least so he interpreted it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia said nothing. Raskolnikov pressed her hand and went out. He felt\r\n",
      "very miserable. If it had been possible to escape to some solitude, he\r\n",
      "would have thought himself lucky, even if he had to spend his whole life\r\n",
      "there. But although he had almost always been by himself of late, he had\r\n",
      "never been able to feel alone. Sometimes he walked out of the town on to\r\n",
      "the high road, once he had even reached a little wood, but the lonelier\r\n",
      "the place was, the more he seemed to be aware of an uneasy presence near\r\n",
      "him. It did not frighten him, but greatly annoyed him, so that he\r\n",
      "made haste to return to the town, to mingle with the crowd, to enter\r\n",
      "restaurants and taverns, to walk in busy thoroughfares. There he felt\r\n",
      "easier and even more solitary. One day at dusk he sat for an hour\r\n",
      "listening to songs in a tavern and he remembered that he positively\r\n",
      "enjoyed it. But at last he had suddenly felt the same uneasiness again,\r\n",
      "as though his conscience smote him. “Here I sit listening to singing,\r\n",
      "is that what I ought to be doing?” he thought. Yet he felt at once\r\n",
      "that that was not the only cause of his uneasiness; there was something\r\n",
      "requiring immediate decision, but it was something he could not clearly\r\n",
      "understand or put into words. It was a hopeless tangle. “No, better the\r\n",
      "struggle again! Better Porfiry again... or Svidrigaïlov.... Better some\r\n",
      "challenge again... some attack. Yes, yes!” he thought. He went out of\r\n",
      "the tavern and rushed away almost at a run. The thought of Dounia and\r\n",
      "his mother suddenly reduced him almost to a panic. That night he woke\r\n",
      "up before morning among some bushes in Krestovsky Island, trembling\r\n",
      "all over with fever; he walked home, and it was early morning when he\r\n",
      "arrived. After some hours’ sleep the fever left him, but he woke up\r\n",
      "late, two o’clock in the afternoon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He remembered that Katerina Ivanovna’s funeral had been fixed for that\r\n",
      "day, and was glad that he was not present at it. Nastasya brought him\r\n",
      "some food; he ate and drank with appetite, almost with greediness. His\r\n",
      "head was fresher and he was calmer than he had been for the last three\r\n",
      "days. He even felt a passing wonder at his previous attacks of panic.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door opened and Razumihin came in.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Ah, he’s eating, then he’s not ill,” said Razumihin. He took a chair\r\n",
      "and sat down at the table opposite Raskolnikov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was troubled and did not attempt to conceal it. He spoke with evident\r\n",
      "annoyance, but without hurry or raising his voice. He looked as though\r\n",
      "he had some special fixed determination.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Listen,” he began resolutely. “As far as I am concerned, you may all go\r\n",
      "to hell, but from what I see, it’s clear to me that I can’t make head or\r\n",
      "tail of it; please don’t think I’ve come to ask you questions. I don’t\r\n",
      "want to know, hang it! If you begin telling me your secrets, I dare say\r\n",
      "I shouldn’t stay to listen, I should go away cursing. I have only come\r\n",
      "to find out once for all whether it’s a fact that you are mad? There is\r\n",
      "a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit\r\n",
      "I’ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid,\r\n",
      "repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior\r\n",
      "to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them\r\n",
      "as you have; so you must be mad.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“When did you see them last?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought\r\n",
      "I’d return your call. I walked in as your door was wide open, I looked\r\n",

      "slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov’s knee.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his\r\n",
      "face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve decided openness is better between us,” Porfiry Petrovitch went\r\n",
      "on, turning his head away and dropping his eyes, as though unwilling to\r\n",

      "“Yes, such suspicions and such scenes cannot continue for long. Nikolay\r\n",
      "put a stop to it, or I don’t know what we might not have come to. That\r\n",

      "that? You know that, of course; and I am aware that he came to you\r\n",
      "afterwards. But what you supposed then was not true: I had not sent for\r\n",
      "anyone, I had made no kind of arrangements. You ask why I hadn’t? What\r\n",
      "shall I say to you? it had all come upon me so suddenly. I had scarcely\r\n",
      "sent for the porters (you noticed them as you went out, I dare say).\r\n",
      "An idea flashed upon me; I was firmly convinced at the time, you see,\r\n",

      "a time, I shall get hold of something else--I shan’t lose what I want,\r\n",
      "anyway. You are nervously irritable, Rodion Romanovitch, by temperament;\r\n",
      "it’s out of proportion with other qualities of your heart and character,\r\n",
      "which I flatter myself I have to some extent divined. Of course I did\r\n",
      "reflect even then that it does not always happen that a man gets up and\r\n",
      "blurts out his whole story. It does happen sometimes, if you make a\r\n",

      "the Hay Market, through which he had come. The whole second storey of\r\n",
      "the house on the left was used as a tavern. All the windows were wide\r\n",
      "open; judging from the figures moving at the windows, the rooms were\r\n",
      "full to overflowing. There were sounds of singing, of clarionet and\r\n",
      "violin, and the boom of a Turkish drum. He could hear women shrieking.\r\n",

      "him, and was watching him. What had passed between them was much the\r\n",
      "same as what happened at their first meeting in Raskolnikov’s room. A\r\n",
      "sly smile came into Svidrigaïlov’s face and grew broader and\r\n",
      "broader. Each knew that he was seen and watched by the other. At last\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov broke into a loud laugh.\r\n",

      "of people of all sorts were drinking tea at twenty little tables to the\r\n",
      "desperate bawling of a chorus of singers. The click of billiard balls\r\n",
      "could be heard in the distance. On the table before Svidrigaïlov stood\r\n",
      "an open bottle and a glass half full of champagne. In the room he found\r\n",
      "also a boy with a little hand organ, a healthy-looking red-cheeked girl\r\n",
      "of eighteen, wearing a tucked-up striped skirt, and a Tyrolese hat with\r\n",
      "ribbons. In spite of the chorus in the other room, she was singing some\r\n",
      "servants’ hall song in a rather husky contralto, to the accompaniment of\r\n",
      "the organ.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Come, that’s enough,” Svidrigaïlov stopped her at Raskolnikov’s\r\n",
      "entrance. The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully.\r\n",
      "She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful\r\n",
      "expression in her face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“As you like, I didn’t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don’t want\r\n",
      "anything more to-day, you can go.” He poured her out a full glass, and\r\n",
      "laid down a yellow note.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down,\r\n",
      "in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov’s hand, which he\r\n",
      "allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed\r\n",
      "after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov had not been a week in Petersburg, but everything about him\r\n",
      "was already, so to speak, on a patriarchal footing; the waiter, Philip,\r\n",
      "was by now an old friend and very obsequious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The door leading to the saloon had a lock on it. Svidrigaïlov was at\r\n",
      "home in this room and perhaps spent whole days in it. The tavern was\r\n",
      "dirty and wretched, not even second-rate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I was going to see you and looking for you,” Raskolnikov began, “but\r\n",

      "just now. I never take this turning. I turn to the right from the Hay\r\n",

      "apropos of the miracle let me tell you that I think you have been asleep\r\n",
      "for the last two or three days. I told you of this tavern myself, there\r\n",

      "convinced there are lots of people in Petersburg who talk to themselves\r\n",
      "as they walk. This is a town of crazy people. If only we had scientific\r\n",
      "men, doctors, lawyers and philosophers might make most valuable\r\n",

      "be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there\r\n",
      "now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out\r\n",
      "of your house--holding your head high--twenty paces from home you let it\r\n",
      "sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see\r\n",
      "nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and\r\n",
      "talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at\r\n",
      "last stand still in the middle of the road. That’s not at all the thing.\r\n",
      "Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won’t do you any good.\r\n",

      "full minute he scrutinised his face, which had impressed him before. It\r\n",
      "was a strange face, like a mask; white and red, with bright red lips,\r\n",
      "with a flaxen beard, and still thick flaxen hair. His eyes were somehow\r\n",
      "too blue and their expression somehow too heavy and fixed. There was\r\n",
      "something awfully unpleasant in that handsome face, which looked so\r\n",
      "wonderfully young for his age. Svidrigaïlov was smartly dressed in light\r\n",

      "I don’t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I\r\n",

      "the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person\r\n",
      "I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I\r\n",
      "gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn’t that enough?\r\n",
      "Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and\r\n",
      "is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me\r\n",
      "not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something\r\n",

      "something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever\r\n",

      "in all the previous conversation. His face quite changed. “I admit it’s\r\n",

      "“You know perhaps--yes, I told you myself,” began Svidrigaïlov, “that\r\n",
      "I was in the debtors’ prison here, for an immense sum, and had not\r\n",
      "any expectation of being able to pay it. There’s no need to go into\r\n",
      "particulars how Marfa Petrovna bought me out; do you know to what a\r\n",
      "point of insanity a woman can sometimes love? She was an honest woman,\r\n",
      "and very sensible, although completely uneducated. Would you believe\r\n",
      "that this honest and jealous woman, after many scenes of hysterics and\r\n",
      "reproaches, condescended to enter into a kind of contract with me which\r\n",
      "she kept throughout our married life? She was considerably older than\r\n",
      "I, and besides, she always kept a clove or something in her mouth. There\r\n",
      "was so much swinishness in my soul and honesty too, of a sort, as to\r\n",
      "tell her straight out that I couldn’t be absolutely faithful to her.\r\n",
      "This confession drove her to frenzy, but yet she seems in a way to have\r\n",
      "liked my brutal frankness. She thought it showed I was unwilling to\r\n",
      "deceive her if I warned her like this beforehand and for a jealous\r\n",
      "woman, you know, that’s the first consideration. After many tears an\r\n",
      "unwritten contract was drawn up between us: first, that I would never\r\n",
      "leave Marfa Petrovna and would always be her husband; secondly, that I\r\n",
      "would never absent myself without her permission; thirdly, that I would\r\n",
      "never set up a permanent mistress; fourthly, in return for this, Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna gave me a free hand with the maidservants, but only with her\r\n",
      "secret knowledge; fifthly, God forbid my falling in love with a woman of\r\n",
      "our class; sixthly, in case I--which God forbid--should be visited by\r\n",
      "a great serious passion I was bound to reveal it to Marfa Petrovna. On\r\n",
      "this last score, however, Marfa Petrovna was fairly at ease. She was a\r\n",
      "sensible woman and so she could not help looking upon me as a dissolute\r\n",
      "profligate incapable of real love. But a sensible woman and a jealous\r\n",
      "woman are two very different things, and that’s where the trouble\r\n",
      "came in. But to judge some people impartially we must renounce certain\r\n",
      "preconceived opinions and our habitual attitude to the ordinary people\r\n",
      "about us. I have reason to have faith in your judgment rather than\r\n",
      "in anyone’s. Perhaps you have already heard a great deal that was\r\n",
      "ridiculous and absurd about Marfa Petrovna. She certainly had some very\r\n",

      "attain its object, it influenced her, it pleased her, indeed. These were\r\n",
      "times when she was positively proud of me. But your sister she couldn’t\r\n",
      "put up with, anyway. And however she came to risk taking such a\r\n",

      "that true?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Don’t refer to those vulgar tales, I beg,” said Svidrigaïlov with\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon\r\n",
      "my soul! I see that I really might pass for a romantic figure with\r\n",
      "some people. Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having\r\n",
      "repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip\r\n",
      "about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any\r\n",

      "did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a\r\n",

      "the daughter of a reigning prince or some governor or pro-consul in Asia\r\n",
      "Minor. She would undoubtedly have been one of those who would endure\r\n",
      "martyrdom and would have smiled when they branded her bosom with hot\r\n",
      "pincers. And she would have gone to it of herself. And in the fourth or\r\n",
      "fifth century she would have walked away into the Egyptian desert and\r\n",
      "would have stayed there thirty years living on roots and ecstasies and\r\n",
      "visions. She is simply thirsting to face some torture for someone, and\r\n",
      "if she can’t get her torture, she’ll throw herself out of a window. I’ve\r\n",
      "heard something of a Mr. Razumihin--he’s said to be a sensible fellow;\r\n",
      "his surname suggests it, indeed. He’s probably a divinity student. Well,\r\n",
      "he’d better look after your sister! I believe I understand her, and I am\r\n",
      "proud of it. But at the beginning of an acquaintance, as you know, one\r\n",
      "is apt to be more heedless and stupid. One doesn’t see clearly. Hang it\r\n",
      "all, why is she so handsome? It’s not my fault. In fact, it began on\r\n",
      "my side with a most irresistible physical desire. Avdotya Romanovna is\r\n",
      "awfully chaste, incredibly and phenomenally so. Take note, I tell you\r\n",
      "this about your sister as a fact. She is almost morbidly chaste, in\r\n",
      "spite of her broad intelligence, and it will stand in her way. There\r\n",
      "happened to be a girl in the house then, Parasha, a black-eyed\r\n",
      "wench, whom I had never seen before--she had just come from another\r\n",
      "village--very pretty, but incredibly stupid: she burst into tears,\r\n",
      "wailed so that she could be heard all over the place and caused scandal.\r\n",
      "One day after dinner Avdotya Romanovna followed me into an avenue in\r\n",
      "the garden and with flashing eyes _insisted_ on my leaving poor Parasha\r\n",
      "alone. It was almost our first conversation by ourselves. I, of course,\r\n",
      "was only too pleased to obey her wishes, tried to appear disconcerted,\r\n",
      "embarrassed, in fact played my part not badly. Then came interviews,\r\n",
      "mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even\r\n",
      "tears--would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for\r\n",
      "propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on\r\n",
      "my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally\r\n",
      "resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the\r\n",
      "female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It’s the well-known\r\n",
      "resource--flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the\r\n",
      "truth and nothing easier than flattery. If there’s the hundredth part\r\n",
      "of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that\r\n",
      "leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it\r\n",
      "is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be\r\n",
      "a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the\r\n",
      "flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true. That’s so for all\r\n",
      "stages of development and classes of society. A vestal virgin might be\r\n",
      "seduced by flattery. I can never remember without laughter how I once\r\n",
      "seduced a lady who was devoted to her husband, her children, and her\r\n",
      "principles. What fun it was and how little trouble! And the lady really\r\n",
      "had principles--of her own, anyway. All my tactics lay in simply being\r\n",
      "utterly annihilated and prostrate before her purity. I flattered her\r\n",
      "shamelessly, and as soon as I succeeded in getting a pressure of\r\n",
      "the hand, even a glance from her, I would reproach myself for having\r\n",
      "snatched it by force, and would declare that she had resisted, so that\r\n",
      "I could never have gained anything but for my being so unprincipled.\r\n",
      "I maintained that she was so innocent that she could not foresee my\r\n",
      "treachery, and yielded to me unconsciously, unawares, and so on. In\r\n",
      "fact, I triumphed, while my lady remained firmly convinced that she was\r\n",
      "innocent, chaste, and faithful to all her duties and obligations and\r\n",
      "had succumbed quite by accident. And how angry she was with me when I\r\n",
      "explained to her at last that it was my sincere conviction that she was\r\n",
      "just as eager as I. Poor Marfa Petrovna was awfully weak on the side of\r\n",
      "flattery, and if I had only cared to, I might have had all her property\r\n",
      "settled on me during her lifetime. (I am drinking an awful lot of wine\r\n",
      "now and talking too much.) I hope you won’t be angry if I mention now\r\n",
      "that I was beginning to produce the same effect on Avdotya Romanovna.\r\n",
      "But I was stupid and impatient and spoiled it all. Avdotya Romanovna had\r\n",
      "several times--and one time in particular--been greatly displeased by\r\n",
      "the expression of my eyes, would you believe it? There was sometimes a\r\n",
      "light in them which frightened her and grew stronger and stronger and\r\n",
      "more unguarded till it was hateful to her. No need to go into detail,\r\n",
      "but we parted. There I acted stupidly again. I fell to jeering in the\r\n",
      "coarsest way at all such propaganda and efforts to convert me; Parasha\r\n",
      "came on to the scene again, and not she alone; in fact there was a\r\n",
      "tremendous to-do. Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, if you could only see how your\r\n",
      "sister’s eyes can flash sometimes! Never mind my being drunk at this\r\n",
      "moment and having had a whole glass of wine. I am speaking the truth.\r\n",
      "I assure you that this glance has haunted my dreams; the very rustle of\r\n",
      "her dress was more than I could stand at last. I really began to think\r\n",
      "that I might become epileptic. I could never have believed that I could\r\n",
      "be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled,\r\n",
      "but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what\r\n",
      "a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake\r\n",
      "anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya\r\n",
      "Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that’s not the word...\r\n",
      "but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by\r\n",
      "her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you\r\n",
      "are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money--thirty\r\n",
      "thousand roubles I could have realised then--if she would run away with\r\n",
      "me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love,\r\n",
      "rapture, and so on. Do you know, I was so wild about her at that time\r\n",
      "that if she had told me to poison Marfa Petrovna or to cut her throat\r\n",
      "and to marry herself, it would have been done at once! But it ended in\r\n",
      "the catastrophe of which you know already. You can fancy how frantic I\r\n",
      "was when I heard that Marfa Petrovna had got hold of that scoundrelly\r\n",
      "attorney, Luzhin, and had almost made a match between them--which would\r\n",
      "really have been just the same thing as I was proposing. Wouldn’t it?\r\n",
      "Wouldn’t it? I notice that you’ve begun to be very attentive... you\r\n",
      "interesting young man....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov struck the table with his fist impatiently. He was flushed.\r\n",

      "that he had sipped almost unconsciously was affecting him--and he\r\n",
      "resolved to take advantage of the opportunity. He felt very suspicious\r\n",

      "at once, for I should like to ask your advice. Ach, hang it, only ten\r\n",
      "minutes left! See, look at the watch. But I must tell you, for it’s an\r\n",
      "interesting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to?\r\n",
      "Going again?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I’m not going away now.”\r\n",

      "betrothed, only not now. For you’ll soon have to be off. You have to go\r\n",
      "to the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the\r\n",
      "woman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you’re thinking, that she’s\r\n",
      "the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are\r\n",

      "you want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy,\r\n",
      "depressed person. Do you think I’m light-hearted? No, I’m gloomy. I do\r\n",
      "no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a\r\n",
      "time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has\r\n",
      "got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and\r\n",
      "depart, and she’ll get hold of her and make a profit out of her--in our\r\n",
      "class, of course, or higher. She told me the father was a broken-down\r\n",
      "retired official, who has been sitting in a chair for the last three\r\n",
      "years with his legs paralysed. The mamma, she said, was a sensible\r\n",
      "woman. There is a son serving in the provinces, but he doesn’t help;\r\n",
      "there is a daughter, who is married, but she doesn’t visit them. And\r\n",
      "they’ve two little nephews on their hands, as though their own children\r\n",
      "were not enough, and they’ve taken from school their youngest daughter,\r\n",
      "a girl who’ll be sixteen in another month, so that then she can be\r\n",
      "married. She was for me. We went there. How funny it was! I present\r\n",
      "myself--a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections,\r\n",
      "with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks\r\n",
      "of that? But it’s fascinating, isn’t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You\r\n",
      "should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying\r\n",
      "to have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy,\r\n",
      "still in a short frock--an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset--she had\r\n",
      "been told, no doubt. I don’t know how you feel about female faces, but\r\n",
      "to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears\r\n",
      "of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little\r\n",
      "picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb’s, full little rosy\r\n",
      "lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends. I told them I was\r\n",
      "in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is\r\n",
      "the day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on\r\n",
      "my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset\r\n",
      "and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that\r\n",
      "this is her husband and that this must be so. It’s simply delicious! The\r\n",
      "present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you\r\n",
      "have what is called _la nature et la vérité_, ha-ha! I’ve talked to her\r\n",
      "twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that\r\n",
      "positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael’s Madonna. You know,\r\n",
      "the Sistine Madonna’s face has something fantastic in it, the face\r\n",
      "of mournful religious ecstasy. Haven’t you noticed it? Well, she’s\r\n",
      "something in that line. The day after we’d been betrothed, I bought her\r\n",
      "presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles--a set of diamonds and\r\n",
      "another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all\r\n",
      "sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna’s face glowed. I sat her\r\n",
      "on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously--she\r\n",
      "flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn’t want to show it.\r\n",
      "We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first\r\n",
      "time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and\r\n",
      "vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make\r\n",
      "me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would\r\n",
      "sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is\r\n",
      "my _respect_, and that she wants ‘nothing, nothing more from me, no\r\n",
      "presents.’ You’ll admit that to hear such a confession, alone, from an\r\n",
      "angel of sixteen in a muslin frock, with little curls, with a flush\r\n",
      "of maiden shyness in her cheeks and tears of enthusiasm in her eyes is\r\n",
      "rather fascinating! Isn’t it fascinating? It’s worth paying for, isn’t\r\n",
      "it? Well... listen, we’ll go to see my betrothed, only not just now!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The fact is this monstrous difference in age and development excites\r\n",
      "your sensuality! Will you really make such a marriage?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, of course. Everyone thinks of himself, and he lives most gaily who\r\n",
      "knows best how to deceive himself. Ha-ha! But why are you so keen about\r\n",
      "virtue? Have mercy on me, my good friend. I am a sinful man. Ha-ha-ha!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But you have provided for the children of Katerina Ivanovna. Though...\r\n",
      "though you had your own reasons.... I understand it all now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am always fond of children, very fond of them,” laughed Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "“I can tell you one curious instance of it. The first day I came here I\r\n",
      "visited various haunts, after seven years I simply rushed at them. You\r\n",
      "probably notice that I am not in a hurry to renew acquaintance with my\r\n",
      "old friends. I shall do without them as long as I can. Do you know, when\r\n",
      "I was with Marfa Petrovna in the country, I was haunted by the thought\r\n",
      "of these places where anyone who knows his way about can find a great\r\n",
      "deal. Yes, upon my soul! The peasants have vodka, the educated young\r\n",
      "people, shut out from activity, waste themselves in impossible dreams\r\n",
      "and visions and are crippled by theories; Jews have sprung up and are\r\n",
      "amassing money, and all the rest give themselves up to debauchery. From\r\n",
      "the first hour the town reeked of its familiar odours. I chanced to be\r\n",
      "in a frightful den--I like my dens dirty--it was a dance, so called, and\r\n",
      "there was a _cancan_ such as I never saw in my day. Yes, there you\r\n",
      "have progress. All of a sudden I saw a little girl of thirteen, nicely\r\n",
      "dressed, dancing with a specialist in that line, with another one\r\n",
      "_vis-à-vis_. Her mother was sitting on a chair by the wall. You can’t\r\n",
      "fancy what a _cancan_ that was! The girl was ashamed, blushed, at\r\n",
      "last felt insulted, and began to cry. Her partner seized her and began\r\n",
      "whirling her round and performing before her; everyone laughed and--I\r\n",
      "like your public, even the _cancan_ public--they laughed and shouted,\r\n",
      "‘Serves her right--serves her right! Shouldn’t bring children!’ Well,\r\n",
      "it’s not my business whether that consoling reflection was logical or\r\n",
      "not. I at once fixed on my plan, sat down by the mother, and began by\r\n",
      "saying that I too was a stranger and that people here were ill-bred and\r\n",
      "that they couldn’t distinguish decent folks and treat them with respect,\r\n",
      "gave her to understand that I had plenty of money, offered to take them\r\n",
      "home in my carriage. I took them home and got to know them. They were\r\n",
      "lodging in a miserable little hole and had only just arrived from the\r\n",
      "country. She told me that she and her daughter could only regard my\r\n",
      "acquaintance as an honour. I found out that they had nothing of their\r\n",
      "own and had come to town upon some legal business. I proffered my\r\n",
      "services and money. I learnt that they had gone to the dancing saloon\r\n",

      "mysterious character. As concerned his sister, Raskolnikov was convinced\r\n",
      "that Svidrigaïlov would not leave her in peace. But it was too tiresome\r\n",
      "and unbearable to go on thinking and thinking about this.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he was alone, he had not gone twenty paces before he sank, as\r\n",
      "usual, into deep thought. On the bridge he stood by the railing and\r\n",
      "began gazing at the water. And his sister was standing close by him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He met her at the entrance to the bridge, but passed by without seeing\r\n",
      "her. Dounia had never met him like this in the street before and was\r\n",
      "struck with dismay. She stood still and did not know whether to call\r\n",
      "to him or not. Suddenly she saw Svidrigaïlov coming quickly from the\r\n",
      "direction of the Hay Market.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed to be approaching cautiously. He did not go on to the\r\n",
      "bridge, but stood aside on the pavement, doing all he could to avoid\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s seeing him. He had observed Dounia for some time and had\r\n",
      "been making signs to her. She fancied he was signalling to beg her not\r\n",
      "to speak to her brother, but to come to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That was what Dounia did. She stole by her brother and went up to\r\n",

      "course, but if not you, who then?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, we’ve turned the corner now,” Dounia interrupted, “and my brother\r\n",
      "won’t see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you.\r\n",
      "Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.”\r\n",

      "“In the first place, I can’t say it in the street; secondly, you must\r\n",
      "hear Sofya Semyonovna too; and, thirdly, I will show you some papers....\r\n",
      "Oh well, if you won’t agree to come with me, I shall refuse to give\r\n",
      "any explanation and go away at once. But I beg you not to forget that\r\n",
      "a very curious secret of your beloved brother’s is entirely in my\r\n",
      "keeping.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia stood still, hesitating, and looked at Svidrigaïlov with\r\n",
      "searching eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you afraid of?” he observed quietly. “The town is not the\r\n",
      "country. And even in the country you did me more harm than I did you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she\r\n",
      "is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother\r\n",
      "to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I\r\n",
      "don’t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken\r\n",
      "to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like\r\n",
      "this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That’s the porter\r\n",
      "of our house--he knows me very well; you see, he’s bowing; he sees I’m\r\n",
      "coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you\r\n",
      "will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse\r\n",
      "my putting things so coarsely. I haven’t a flat to myself; Sofya\r\n",
      "Semyonovna’s room is next to mine--she lodges in the next flat. The\r\n",
      "whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child?\r\n",
      "Am I really so terrible?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "no smiling mood. His heart was throbbing and he could scarcely breathe.\r\n",
      "He spoke rather loud to cover his growing excitement. But Dounia did not\r\n",
      "notice this peculiar excitement, she was so irritated by his remark that\r\n",
      "she was frightened of him like a child and that he was so terrible to\r\n",
      "her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Though I know that you are not a man... of honour, I am not in the\r\n",

      "unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she’s gone out, it\r\n",
      "can only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead....\r\n",
      "I’ve been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna\r\n",
      "does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if\r\n",
      "you like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich,\r\n",
      "my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you\r\n",

      "into them with some attention.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was\r\n",
      "looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the\r\n",
      "furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe,\r\n",
      "for instance, that Svidrigaïlov’s flat was exactly between two sets of\r\n",
      "almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly\r\n",
      "from the passage, but through the landlady’s two almost empty rooms.\r\n",
      "Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidrigaïlov showed Dounia\r\n",
      "the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not\r\n",
      "knowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidrigaïlov hastened to\r\n",
      "explain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it’s locked.\r\n",
      "By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it\r\n",
      "from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently. Just the other side of\r\n",
      "the door is Sofya Semyonovna’s table; she sat there talking to Rodion\r\n",
      "Romanovitch. And I sat here listening on two successive evenings, for\r\n",
      "two hours each time--and of course I was able to learn something, what\r\n",
      "do you think?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He brought Avdotya Romanovna back into his sitting-room and offered her\r\n",
      "a chair. He sat down at the opposite side of the table, at least seven\r\n",
      "feet from her, but probably there was the same glow in his eyes which\r\n",
      "had once frightened Dounia so much. She shuddered and once more looked\r\n",
      "about her distrustfully. It was an involuntary gesture; she evidently\r\n",
      "did not wish to betray her uneasiness. But the secluded position of\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov’s lodging had suddenly struck her. She wanted to ask\r\n",
      "whether his landlady at least were at home, but pride kept her from\r\n",
      "asking. Moreover, she had another trouble in her heart incomparably\r\n",
      "greater than fear for herself. She was in great distress.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here is your letter,” she said, laying it on the table. “Can it be true\r\n",
      "what you write? You hint at a crime committed, you say, by my brother.\r\n",
      "You hint at it too clearly; you daren’t deny it now. I must tell you\r\n",
      "that I’d heard of this stupid story before you wrote and don’t believe a\r\n",
      "word of it. It’s a disgusting and ridiculous suspicion. I know the story\r\n",
      "and why and how it was invented. You can have no proofs. You promised to\r\n",
      "prove it. Speak! But let me warn you that I don’t believe you! I don’t\r\n",
      "believe you!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "no remorse even if... you were willing to save your brother of your\r\n",
      "own accord, as I suggest to you. You would be simply submitting to\r\n",
      "circumstances, to violence, in fact, if we must use that word. Think\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“It’s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed,\r\n",

      "pretty wild creature. Well, shoot away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the\r\n",
      "distance and awaiting the first movement on his part. Her lower lip was\r\n",
      "white and quivering and her big black eyes flashed like fire. He had\r\n",
      "never seen her so handsome. The fire glowing in her eyes at the moment\r\n",
      "she raised the revolver seemed to kindle him and there was a pang of\r\n",
      "anguish in his heart. He took a step forward and a shot rang out. The\r\n",
      "bullet grazed his hair and flew into the wall behind. He stood still and\r\n",
      "laughed softly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“The wasp has stung me. She aimed straight at my head. What’s this?\r\n",
      "Blood?” he pulled out his handkerchief to wipe the blood, which flowed\r\n",
      "in a thin stream down his right temple. The bullet seemed to have just\r\n",
      "grazed the skin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia lowered the revolver and looked at Svidrigaïlov not so much in\r\n",
      "terror as in a sort of wild amazement. She seemed not to understand what\r\n",
      "she was doing and what was going on.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well, you missed! Fire again, I’ll wait,” said Svidrigaïlov softly,\r\n",
      "still smiling, but gloomily. “If you go on like that, I shall have time\r\n",
      "to seize you before you cock again.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia started, quickly cocked the pistol and again raised it.\r\n",

      "kill you.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Well... at three paces you can hardly help it. But if you don’t...\r\n",
      "then.” His eyes flashed and he took two steps forward. Dounia shot\r\n",
      "again: it missed fire.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You haven’t loaded it properly. Never mind, you have another charge\r\n",
      "there. Get it ready, I’ll wait.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stood facing her, two paces away, waiting and gazing at her with wild\r\n",
      "determination, with feverishly passionate, stubborn, set eyes. Dounia\r\n",
      "saw that he would sooner die than let her go. “And... now, of course she\r\n",
      "would kill him, at two paces!” Suddenly she flung away the revolver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“She’s dropped it!” said Svidrigaïlov with surprise, and he drew a deep\r\n",
      "breath. A weight seemed to have rolled from his heart--perhaps not only\r\n",
      "the fear of death; indeed he may scarcely have felt it at that moment.\r\n",
      "It was the deliverance from another feeling, darker and more bitter,\r\n",
      "which he could not himself have defined.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went to Dounia and gently put his arm round her waist. She did not\r\n",
      "resist, but, trembling like a leaf, looked at him with suppliant eyes.\r\n",
      "He tried to say something, but his lips moved without being able to\r\n",
      "utter a sound.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Let me go,” Dounia implored. Svidrigaïlov shuddered. Her voice now was\r\n",
      "quite different.\r\n",

      "“Then you don’t love me?” he asked softly. Dounia shook her head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And... and you can’t? Never?” he whispered in despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Never!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There followed a moment of terrible, dumb struggle in the heart of\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov. He looked at her with an indescribable gaze. Suddenly\r\n",
      "he withdrew his arm, turned quickly to the window and stood facing it.\r\n",
      "Another moment passed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here’s the key.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "behind him, without turning or looking at Dounia.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Take it! Make haste!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked stubbornly out of the window. Dounia went up to the table to\r\n",
      "take the key.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Make haste! Make haste!” repeated Svidrigaïlov, still without turning\r\n",
      "or moving. But there seemed a terrible significance in the tone of that\r\n",
      "“make haste.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Dounia understood it, snatched up the key, flew to the door, unlocked it\r\n",
      "quickly and rushed out of the room. A minute later, beside herself, she\r\n",
      "ran out on to the canal bank in the direction of X. Bridge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov remained three minutes standing at the window. At last he\r\n",
      "slowly turned, looked about him and passed his hand over his forehead. A\r\n",
      "strange smile contorted his face, a pitiful, sad, weak smile, a smile of\r\n",
      "despair. The blood, which was already getting dry, smeared his hand.\r\n",
      "He looked angrily at it, then wetted a towel and washed his temple.\r\n",
      "The revolver which Dounia had flung away lay near the door and suddenly\r\n",

      "three-barrel revolver of old-fashioned construction. There were still\r\n",
      "two charges and one capsule left in it. It could be fired again. He\r\n",

      "He spent that evening till ten o’clock going from one low haunt to\r\n",
      "another. Katia too turned up and sang another gutter song, how a certain\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“villain and tyrant,”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“began kissing Katia.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov treated Katia and the organ-grinder and some singers and\r\n",
      "the waiters and two little clerks. He was particularly drawn to these\r\n",
      "clerks by the fact that they both had crooked noses, one bent to the\r\n",
      "left and the other to the right. They took him finally to a pleasure\r\n",
      "garden, where he paid for their entrance. There was one lanky\r\n",
      "three-year-old pine-tree and three bushes in the garden, besides a\r\n",
      "“Vauxhall,” which was in reality a drinking-bar where tea too was\r\n",
      "served, and there were a few green tables and chairs standing round it.\r\n",
      "A chorus of wretched singers and a drunken but exceedingly depressed\r\n",
      "German clown from Munich with a red nose entertained the public. The\r\n",
      "clerks quarrelled with some other clerks and a fight seemed imminent.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov was chosen to decide the dispute. He listened to them for\r\n",
      "a quarter of an hour, but they shouted so loud that there was no\r\n",
      "possibility of understanding them. The only fact that seemed certain was\r\n",
      "that one of them had stolen something and had even succeeded in\r\n",
      "selling it on the spot to a Jew, but would not share the spoil with his\r\n",
      "companion. Finally it appeared that the stolen object was a teaspoon\r\n",
      "belonging to the Vauxhall. It was missed and the affair began to seem\r\n",
      "troublesome. Svidrigaïlov paid for the spoon, got up, and walked out of\r\n",
      "the garden. It was about six o’clock. He had not drunk a drop of wine\r\n",
      "all this time and had ordered tea more for the sake of appearances than\r\n",
      "anything.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was a dark and stifling evening. Threatening storm-clouds came over\r\n",
      "the sky about ten o’clock. There was a clap of thunder, and the rain\r\n",
      "came down like a waterfall. The water fell not in drops, but beat on the\r\n",
      "earth in streams. There were flashes of lightning every minute and each\r\n",
      "flash lasted while one could count five.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Drenched to the skin, he went home, locked himself in, opened the\r\n",
      "bureau, took out all his money and tore up two or three papers. Then,\r\n",
      "putting the money in his pocket, he was about to change his clothes,\r\n",
      "but, looking out of the window and listening to the thunder and the\r\n",
      "rain, he gave up the idea, took up his hat and went out of the room\r\n",
      "without locking the door. He went straight to Sonia. She was at home.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was not alone: the four Kapernaumov children were with her. She\r\n",
      "was giving them tea. She received Svidrigaïlov in respectful silence,\r\n",
      "looking wonderingly at his soaking clothes. The children all ran away at\r\n",
      "once in indescribable terror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov sat down at the table and asked Sonia to sit beside him.\r\n",
      "She timidly prepared to listen.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I may be going to America, Sofya Semyonovna,” said Svidrigaïlov, “and\r\n",
      "as I am probably seeing you for the last time, I have come to make some\r\n",
      "arrangements. Well, did you see the lady to-day? I know what she said to\r\n",
      "you, you need not tell me.” (Sonia made a movement and blushed.) “Those\r\n",
      "people have their own way of doing things. As to your sisters and your\r\n",
      "brother, they are really provided for and the money assigned to them\r\n",
      "I’ve put into safe keeping and have received acknowledgments. You had\r\n",
      "better take charge of the receipts, in case anything happens. Here, take\r\n",
      "them! Well now, that’s settled. Here are three 5-per-cent bonds to the\r\n",
      "value of three thousand roubles. Take those for yourself, entirely for\r\n",
      "yourself, and let that be strictly between ourselves, so that no one\r\n",
      "knows of it, whatever you hear. You will need the money, for to go on\r\n",
      "living in the old way, Sofya Semyonovna, is bad, and besides there is no\r\n",
      "need for it now.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I am so much indebted to you, and so are the children and my\r\n",
      "stepmother,” said Sonia hurriedly, “and if I’ve said so little... please\r\n",
      "don’t consider...”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“That’s enough! that’s enough!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“But as for the money, Arkady Ivanovitch, I am very grateful to you,\r\n",
      "but I don’t need it now. I can always earn my own living. Don’t think me\r\n",
      "ungrateful. If you are so charitable, that money....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s for you, for you, Sofya Semyonovna, and please don’t waste words\r\n",
      "over it. I haven’t time for it. You will want it. Rodion Romanovitch\r\n",
      "has two alternatives: a bullet in the brain or Siberia.” (Sonia looked\r\n",
      "wildly at him, and started.) “Don’t be uneasy, I know all about it from\r\n",
      "himself and I am not a gossip; I won’t tell anyone. It was good advice\r\n",
      "when you told him to give himself up and confess. It would be much\r\n",
      "better for him. Well, if it turns out to be Siberia, he will go and\r\n",
      "you will follow him. That’s so, isn’t it? And if so, you’ll need money.\r\n",
      "You’ll need it for him, do you understand? Giving it to you is the same\r\n",
      "as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay\r\n",
      "what’s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so\r\n",
      "heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna’s debt and not\r\n",
      "yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman.\r\n",
      "You can’t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned\r\n",
      "about me--to-morrow or the day after you will be asked--don’t say\r\n",
      "anything about my coming to see you now and don’t show the money to\r\n",
      "anyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye.” (He got up.) “My\r\n",
      "greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you’d better put the money\r\n",
      "for the present in Mr. Razumihin’s keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of\r\n",
      "course you do. He’s not a bad fellow. Take it to him to-morrow or...\r\n",
      "when the time comes. And till then, hide it carefully.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia too jumped up from her chair and looked in dismay at Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "She longed to speak, to ask a question, but for the first moments she\r\n",
      "did not dare and did not know how to begin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“How can you... how can you be going now, in such rain?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, be starting for America, and be stopped by rain! Ha, ha! Good-bye,\r\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna, my dear! Live and live long, you will be of use to\r\n",
      "others. By the way... tell Mr. Razumihin I send my greetings to him.\r\n",
      "Tell him Arkady Ivanovitch Svidrigaïlov sends his greetings. Be sure\r\n",
      "to.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went out, leaving Sonia in a state of wondering anxiety and vague\r\n",
      "apprehension.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It appeared afterwards that on the same evening, at twenty past eleven,\r\n",
      "he made another very eccentric and unexpected visit. The rain still\r\n",
      "persisted. Drenched to the skin, he walked into the little flat where\r\n",
      "the parents of his betrothed lived, in Third Street in Vassilyevsky\r\n",
      "Island. He knocked some time before he was admitted, and his visit\r\n",
      "at first caused great perturbation; but Svidrigaïlov could be\r\n",
      "very fascinating when he liked, so that the first, and indeed very\r\n",
      "intelligent surmise of the sensible parents that Svidrigaïlov had\r\n",
      "probably had so much to drink that he did not know what he was doing\r\n",
      "vanished immediately. The decrepit father was wheeled in to see\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov by the tender and sensible mother, who as usual began the\r\n",
      "conversation with various irrelevant questions. She never asked a direct\r\n",
      "question, but began by smiling and rubbing her hands and then, if she\r\n",
      "were obliged to ascertain something--for instance, when Svidrigaïlov\r\n",
      "would like to have the wedding--she would begin by interested and\r\n",
      "almost eager questions about Paris and the court life there, and only\r\n",
      "by degrees brought the conversation round to Third Street. On other\r\n",
      "occasions this had of course been very impressive, but this time Arkady\r\n",
      "Ivanovitch seemed particularly impatient, and insisted on seeing his\r\n",
      "betrothed at once, though he had been informed, to begin with, that she\r\n",
      "had already gone to bed. The girl of course appeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov informed her at once that he was obliged by very important\r\n",
      "affairs to leave Petersburg for a time, and therefore brought her\r\n",
      "fifteen thousand roubles and begged her accept them as a present from\r\n",
      "him, as he had long been intending to make her this trifling present\r\n",
      "before their wedding. The logical connection of the present with his\r\n",
      "immediate departure and the absolute necessity of visiting them for that\r\n",
      "purpose in pouring rain at midnight was not made clear. But it all went\r\n",
      "off very well; even the inevitable ejaculations of wonder and regret,\r\n",
      "the inevitable questions were extraordinarily few and restrained. On the\r\n",
      "other hand, the gratitude expressed was most glowing and was reinforced\r\n",
      "by tears from the most sensible of mothers. Svidrigaïlov got up,\r\n",
      "laughed, kissed his betrothed, patted her cheek, declared he would soon\r\n",
      "come back, and noticing in her eyes, together with childish curiosity, a\r\n",
      "sort of earnest dumb inquiry, reflected and kissed her again, though\r\n",
      "he felt sincere anger inwardly at the thought that his present would be\r\n",
      "immediately locked up in the keeping of the most sensible of mothers. He\r\n",
      "went away, leaving them all in a state of extraordinary excitement, but\r\n",
      "the tender mamma, speaking quietly in a half whisper, settled some of\r\n",
      "the most important of their doubts, concluding that Svidrigaïlov was\r\n",
      "a great man, a man of great affairs and connections and of great\r\n",
      "wealth--there was no knowing what he had in his mind. He would start\r\n",
      "off on a journey and give away money just as the fancy took him, so that\r\n",
      "there was nothing surprising about it. Of course it was strange that he\r\n",
      "was wet through, but Englishmen, for instance, are even more eccentric,\r\n",
      "and all these people of high society didn’t think of what was said of\r\n",
      "them and didn’t stand on ceremony. Possibly, indeed, he came like that\r\n",
      "on purpose to show that he was not afraid of anyone. Above all, not a\r\n",
      "word should be said about it, for God knows what might come of it, and\r\n",
      "the money must be locked up, and it was most fortunate that Fedosya, the\r\n",
      "cook, had not left the kitchen. And above all not a word must be said\r\n",
      "to that old cat, Madame Resslich, and so on and so on. They sat up\r\n",
      "whispering till two o’clock, but the girl went to bed much earlier,\r\n",
      "amazed and rather sorrowful.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov meanwhile, exactly at midnight, crossed the bridge on the\r\n",
      "way back to the mainland. The rain had ceased and there was a roaring\r\n",
      "wind. He began shivering, and for one moment he gazed at the black\r\n",
      "waters of the Little Neva with a look of special interest, even inquiry.\r\n",
      "But he soon felt it very cold, standing by the water; he turned and\r\n",
      "went towards Y. Prospect. He walked along that endless street for a long\r\n",
      "time, almost half an hour, more than once stumbling in the dark on the\r\n",
      "wooden pavement, but continually looking for something on the right side\r\n",
      "of the street. He had noticed passing through this street lately that\r\n",
      "there was a hotel somewhere towards the end, built of wood, but fairly\r\n",
      "large, and its name he remembered was something like Adrianople. He was\r\n",
      "not mistaken: the hotel was so conspicuous in that God-forsaken place\r\n",
      "that he could not fail to see it even in the dark. It was a long,\r\n",
      "blackened wooden building, and in spite of the late hour there were\r\n",
      "lights in the windows and signs of life within. He went in and asked\r\n",
      "a ragged fellow who met him in the corridor for a room. The latter,\r\n",
      "scanning Svidrigaïlov, pulled himself together and led him at once to a\r\n",
      "close and tiny room in the distance, at the end of the corridor, under\r\n",
      "the stairs. There was no other, all were occupied. The ragged fellow\r\n",
      "looked inquiringly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Is there tea?” asked Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Yes, sir.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What else is there?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Veal, vodka, savouries.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Bring me tea and veal.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“And you want nothing else?” he asked with apparent surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, nothing.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ragged man went away, completely disillusioned.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It must be a nice place,” thought Svidrigaïlov. “How was it I didn’t\r\n",
      "know it? I expect I look as if I came from a café chantant and have\r\n",
      "had some adventure on the way. It would be interesting to know who stayed\r\n",
      "here?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lighted the candle and looked at the room more carefully. It was a\r\n",
      "room so low-pitched that Svidrigaïlov could only just stand up in it;\r\n",
      "it had one window; the bed, which was very dirty, and the plain-stained\r\n",
      "chair and table almost filled it up. The walls looked as though they\r\n",
      "were made of planks, covered with shabby paper, so torn and dusty\r\n",
      "that the pattern was indistinguishable, though the general\r\n",
      "colour--yellow--could still be made out. One of the walls was cut short\r\n",
      "by the sloping ceiling, though the room was not an attic but just under\r\n",
      "the stairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov set down the candle, sat down on the bed and sank into\r\n",
      "thought. But a strange persistent murmur which sometimes rose to a shout\r\n",
      "in the next room attracted his attention. The murmur had not ceased from\r\n",
      "the moment he entered the room. He listened: someone was upbraiding and\r\n",
      "almost tearfully scolding, but he heard only one voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov got up, shaded the light with his hand and at once he saw\r\n",
      "light through a crack in the wall; he went up and peeped through. The\r\n",
      "room, which was somewhat larger than his, had two occupants. One of\r\n",
      "them, a very curly-headed man with a red inflamed face, was standing\r\n",
      "in the pose of an orator, without his coat, with his legs wide apart to\r\n",
      "preserve his balance, and smiting himself on the breast. He reproached\r\n",
      "the other with being a beggar, with having no standing whatever. He\r\n",
      "declared that he had taken the other out of the gutter and he could turn\r\n",
      "him out when he liked, and that only the finger of Providence sees it\r\n",
      "all. The object of his reproaches was sitting in a chair, and had the\r\n",
      "air of a man who wants dreadfully to sneeze, but can’t. He sometimes\r\n",
      "turned sheepish and befogged eyes on the speaker, but obviously had not\r\n",
      "the slightest idea what he was talking about and scarcely heard it. A\r\n",
      "candle was burning down on the table; there were wine-glasses, a nearly\r\n",
      "empty bottle of vodka, bread and cucumber, and glasses with the dregs\r\n",
      "of stale tea. After gazing attentively at this, Svidrigaïlov turned away\r\n",
      "indifferently and sat down on the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ragged attendant, returning with the tea, could not resist asking\r\n",
      "him again whether he didn’t want anything more, and again receiving a\r\n",
      "negative reply, finally withdrew. Svidrigaïlov made haste to drink a\r\n",
      "glass of tea to warm himself, but could not eat anything. He began\r\n",
      "to feel feverish. He took off his coat and, wrapping himself in the\r\n",
      "blanket, lay down on the bed. He was annoyed. “It would have been better\r\n",
      "to be well for the occasion,” he thought with a smile. The room was\r\n",
      "close, the candle burnt dimly, the wind was roaring outside, he heard\r\n",
      "a mouse scratching in the corner and the room smelt of mice and of\r\n",
      "leather. He lay in a sort of reverie: one thought followed another. He\r\n",
      "felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. “It must be a garden\r\n",
      "under the window,” he thought. “There’s a sound of trees. How I dislike\r\n",
      "the sound of trees on a stormy night, in the dark! They give one a\r\n",
      "horrid feeling.” He remembered how he had disliked it when he passed\r\n",
      "Petrovsky Park just now. This reminded him of the bridge over the Little\r\n",
      "Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. “I never have\r\n",
      "liked water,” he thought, “even in a landscape,” and he suddenly smiled\r\n",
      "again at a strange idea: “Surely now all these questions of taste and\r\n",
      "comfort ought not to matter, but I’ve become more particular, like an\r\n",
      "animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion. I ought\r\n",
      "to have gone into the Petrovsky Park! I suppose it seemed dark, cold,\r\n",
      "ha-ha! As though I were seeking pleasant sensations!... By the way, why\r\n",
      "haven’t I put out the candle?” he blew it out. “They’ve gone to bed next\r\n",
      "door,” he thought, not seeing the light at the crack. “Well, now, Marfa\r\n",
      "Petrovna, now is the time for you to turn up; it’s dark, and the very\r\n",
      "time and place for you. But now you won’t come!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly recalled how, an hour before carrying out his design on\r\n",
      "Dounia, he had recommended Raskolnikov to trust her to Razumihin’s\r\n",
      "keeping. “I suppose I really did say it, as Raskolnikov guessed, to\r\n",
      "tease myself. But what a rogue that Raskolnikov is! He’s gone through a\r\n",
      "good deal. He may be a successful rogue in time when he’s got over\r\n",
      "his nonsense. But now he’s _too_ eager for life. These young men\r\n",
      "are contemptible on that point. But, hang the fellow! Let him please\r\n",
      "himself, it’s nothing to do with me.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He could not get to sleep. By degrees Dounia’s image rose before him,\r\n",
      "and a shudder ran over him. “No, I must give up all that now,” he\r\n",
      "thought, rousing himself. “I must think of something else. It’s queer\r\n",
      "and funny. I never had a great hatred for anyone, I never particularly\r\n",
      "desired to avenge myself even, and that’s a bad sign, a bad sign, a bad\r\n",
      "sign. I never liked quarrelling either, and never lost my temper--that’s\r\n",
      "a bad sign too. And the promises I made her just now, too--Damnation!\r\n",
      "But--who knows?--perhaps she would have made a new man of me\r\n",
      "somehow....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He ground his teeth and sank into silence again. Again Dounia’s image\r\n",
      "rose before him, just as she was when, after shooting the first time,\r\n",
      "she had lowered the revolver in terror and gazed blankly at him, so that\r\n",
      "he might have seized her twice over and she would not have lifted a hand\r\n",
      "to defend herself if he had not reminded her. He recalled how at that\r\n",
      "instant he felt almost sorry for her, how he had felt a pang at his\r\n",
      "heart...\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aïe! Damnation, these thoughts again! I must put it away!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was dozing off; the feverish shiver had ceased, when suddenly\r\n",
      "something seemed to run over his arm and leg under the bedclothes. He\r\n",
      "started. “Ugh! hang it! I believe it’s a mouse,” he thought, “that’s the\r\n",
      "veal I left on the table.” He felt fearfully disinclined to pull off the\r\n",
      "blanket, get up, get cold, but all at once something unpleasant ran over\r\n",
      "his leg again. He pulled off the blanket and lighted the candle. Shaking\r\n",
      "with feverish chill he bent down to examine the bed: there was nothing.\r\n",
      "He shook the blanket and suddenly a mouse jumped out on the sheet.\r\n",
      "He tried to catch it, but the mouse ran to and fro in zigzags without\r\n",
      "leaving the bed, slipped between his fingers, ran over his hand and\r\n",
      "suddenly darted under the pillow. He threw down the pillow, but in one\r\n",
      "instant felt something leap on his chest and dart over his body and down\r\n",
      "his back under his shirt. He trembled nervously and woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The room was dark. He was lying on the bed and wrapped up in the blanket\r\n",
      "as before. The wind was howling under the window. “How disgusting,” he\r\n",
      "thought with annoyance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He got up and sat on the edge of the bedstead with his back to the\r\n",
      "window. “It’s better not to sleep at all,” he decided. There was a cold\r\n",
      "damp draught from the window, however; without getting up he drew the\r\n",
      "blanket over him and wrapped himself in it. He was not thinking of\r\n",
      "anything and did not want to think. But one image rose after another,\r\n",
      "incoherent scraps of thought without beginning or end passed through his\r\n",
      "mind. He sank into drowsiness. Perhaps the cold, or the dampness, or\r\n",
      "the dark, or the wind that howled under the window and tossed the trees\r\n",
      "roused a sort of persistent craving for the fantastic. He kept dwelling\r\n",
      "on images of flowers, he fancied a charming flower garden, a bright,\r\n",
      "warm, almost hot day, a holiday--Trinity day. A fine, sumptuous country\r\n",
      "cottage in the English taste overgrown with fragrant flowers, with\r\n",
      "flower beds going round the house; the porch, wreathed in climbers, was\r\n",
      "surrounded with beds of roses. A light, cool staircase, carpeted with\r\n",
      "rich rugs, was decorated with rare plants in china pots. He noticed\r\n",
      "particularly in the windows nosegays of tender, white, heavily fragrant\r\n",
      "narcissus bending over their bright, green, thick long stalks. He was\r\n",
      "reluctant to move away from them, but he went up the stairs and came\r\n",
      "into a large, high drawing-room and again everywhere--at the windows,\r\n",
      "the doors on to the balcony, and on the balcony itself--were flowers.\r\n",
      "The floors were strewn with freshly-cut fragrant hay, the windows\r\n",
      "were open, a fresh, cool, light air came into the room. The birds were\r\n",
      "chirruping under the window, and in the middle of the room, on a table\r\n",
      "covered with a white satin shroud, stood a coffin. The coffin was\r\n",
      "covered with white silk and edged with a thick white frill; wreaths of\r\n",
      "flowers surrounded it on all sides. Among the flowers lay a girl in a\r\n",
      "white muslin dress, with her arms crossed and pressed on her bosom, as\r\n",
      "though carved out of marble. But her loose fair hair was wet; there was\r\n",
      "a wreath of roses on her head. The stern and already rigid profile of\r\n",
      "her face looked as though chiselled of marble too, and the smile on her\r\n",
      "pale lips was full of an immense unchildish misery and sorrowful appeal.\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov knew that girl; there was no holy image, no burning candle\r\n",
      "beside the coffin; no sound of prayers: the girl had drowned herself.\r\n",
      "She was only fourteen, but her heart was broken. And she had destroyed\r\n",
      "herself, crushed by an insult that had appalled and amazed that childish\r\n",
      "soul, had smirched that angel purity with unmerited disgrace and torn\r\n",
      "from her a last scream of despair, unheeded and brutally disregarded, on\r\n",
      "a dark night in the cold and wet while the wind howled....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov came to himself, got up from the bed and went to the\r\n",
      "window. He felt for the latch and opened it. The wind lashed furiously\r\n",
      "into the little room and stung his face and his chest, only covered with\r\n",
      "his shirt, as though with frost. Under the window there must have been\r\n",
      "something like a garden, and apparently a pleasure garden. There, too,\r\n",
      "probably there were tea-tables and singing in the daytime. Now drops of\r\n",
      "rain flew in at the window from the trees and bushes; it was dark as\r\n",
      "in a cellar, so that he could only just make out some dark blurs of\r\n",
      "objects. Svidrigaïlov, bending down with elbows on the window-sill,\r\n",
      "gazed for five minutes into the darkness; the boom of a cannon, followed\r\n",
      "by a second one, resounded in the darkness of the night. “Ah, the\r\n",
      "signal! The river is overflowing,” he thought. “By morning it will be\r\n",
      "swirling down the street in the lower parts, flooding the basements and\r\n",
      "cellars. The cellar rats will swim out, and men will curse in the rain\r\n",
      "and wind as they drag their rubbish to their upper storeys. What time is\r\n",
      "it now?” And he had hardly thought it when, somewhere near, a clock on\r\n",
      "the wall, ticking away hurriedly, struck three.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Aha! It will be light in an hour! Why wait? I’ll go out at once\r\n",
      "straight to the park. I’ll choose a great bush there drenched with rain,\r\n",
      "so that as soon as one’s shoulder touches it, millions of drops drip on\r\n",
      "one’s head.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He moved away from the window, shut it, lighted the candle, put on his\r\n",
      "waistcoat, his overcoat and his hat and went out, carrying the candle,\r\n",
      "into the passage to look for the ragged attendant who would be asleep\r\n",
      "somewhere in the midst of candle-ends and all sorts of rubbish, to pay\r\n",
      "him for the room and leave the hotel. “It’s the best minute; I couldn’t\r\n",
      "choose a better.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He walked for some time through a long narrow corridor without finding\r\n",
      "anyone and was just going to call out, when suddenly in a dark corner\r\n",
      "between an old cupboard and the door he caught sight of a strange object\r\n",
      "which seemed to be alive. He bent down with the candle and saw a little\r\n",
      "girl, not more than five years old, shivering and crying, with her\r\n",
      "clothes as wet as a soaking house-flannel. She did not seem afraid of\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov, but looked at him with blank amazement out of her big\r\n",
      "black eyes. Now and then she sobbed as children do when they have been\r\n",
      "crying a long time, but are beginning to be comforted. The child’s face\r\n",
      "was pale and tired, she was numb with cold. “How can she have come here?\r\n",
      "She must have hidden here and not slept all night.” He began questioning\r\n",
      "her. The child suddenly becoming animated, chattered away in her baby\r\n",
      "language, something about “mammy” and that “mammy would beat her,” and\r\n",
      "about some cup that she had “bwoken.” The child chattered on without\r\n",
      "stopping. He could only guess from what she said that she was a\r\n",
      "neglected child, whose mother, probably a drunken cook, in the service\r\n",
      "of the hotel, whipped and frightened her; that the child had broken\r\n",
      "a cup of her mother’s and was so frightened that she had run away the\r\n",
      "evening before, had hidden for a long while somewhere outside in the\r\n",
      "rain, at last had made her way in here, hidden behind the cupboard and\r\n",
      "spent the night there, crying and trembling from the damp, the darkness\r\n",
      "and the fear that she would be badly beaten for it. He took her in his\r\n",
      "arms, went back to his room, sat her on the bed, and began undressing\r\n",
      "her. The torn shoes which she had on her stockingless feet were as\r\n",
      "wet as if they had been standing in a puddle all night. When he had\r\n",
      "undressed her, he put her on the bed, covered her up and wrapped her in\r\n",
      "the blanket from her head downwards. She fell asleep at once. Then he\r\n",
      "sank into dreary musing again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What folly to trouble myself,” he decided suddenly with an oppressive\r\n",
      "feeling of annoyance. “What idiocy!” In vexation he took up the candle\r\n",
      "to go and look for the ragged attendant again and make haste to go away.\r\n",
      "“Damn the child!” he thought as he opened the door, but he turned again\r\n",
      "to see whether the child was asleep. He raised the blanket carefully.\r\n",
      "The child was sleeping soundly, she had got warm under the blanket,\r\n",
      "and her pale cheeks were flushed. But strange to say that flush seemed\r\n",
      "brighter and coarser than the rosy cheeks of childhood. “It’s a flush\r\n",
      "of fever,” thought Svidrigaïlov. It was like the flush from drinking, as\r\n",
      "though she had been given a full glass to drink. Her crimson lips were\r\n",
      "hot and glowing; but what was this? He suddenly fancied that her long\r\n",
      "black eyelashes were quivering, as though the lids were opening and a\r\n",
      "sly crafty eye peeped out with an unchildlike wink, as though the little\r\n",
      "girl were not asleep, but pretending. Yes, it was so. Her lips parted in\r\n",
      "a smile. The corners of her mouth quivered, as though she were trying to\r\n",
      "control them. But now she quite gave up all effort, now it was a grin,\r\n",
      "a broad grin; there was something shameless, provocative in that quite\r\n",
      "unchildish face; it was depravity, it was the face of a harlot, the\r\n",
      "shameless face of a French harlot. Now both eyes opened wide; they\r\n",
      "turned a glowing, shameless glance upon him; they laughed, invited\r\n",
      "him.... There was something infinitely hideous and shocking in that\r\n",
      "laugh, in those eyes, in such nastiness in the face of a child. “What,\r\n",
      "at five years old?” Svidrigaïlov muttered in genuine horror. “What does\r\n",
      "it mean?” And now she turned to him, her little face all aglow, holding\r\n",
      "out her arms.... “Accursed child!” Svidrigaïlov cried, raising his hand\r\n",
      "to strike her, but at that moment he woke up.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was in the same bed, still wrapped in the blanket. The candle had not\r\n",
      "been lighted, and daylight was streaming in at the windows.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“I’ve had nightmare all night!” He got up angrily, feeling utterly\r\n",
      "shattered; his bones ached. There was a thick mist outside and he could\r\n",
      "see nothing. It was nearly five. He had overslept himself! He got up,\r\n",
      "put on his still damp jacket and overcoat. Feeling the revolver in his\r\n",
      "pocket, he took it out and then he sat down, took a notebook out of his\r\n",
      "pocket and in the most conspicuous place on the title page wrote a few\r\n",
      "lines in large letters. Reading them over, he sank into thought with his\r\n",
      "elbows on the table. The revolver and the notebook lay beside him. Some\r\n",
      "flies woke up and settled on the untouched veal, which was still on\r\n",
      "the table. He stared at them and at last with his free right hand began\r\n",
      "trying to catch one. He tried till he was tired, but could not catch it.\r\n",
      "At last, realising that he was engaged in this interesting pursuit, he\r\n",
      "started, got up and walked resolutely out of the room. A minute later he\r\n",
      "was in the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A thick milky mist hung over the town. Svidrigaïlov walked along the\r\n",
      "slippery dirty wooden pavement towards the Little Neva. He was picturing\r\n",
      "the waters of the Little Neva swollen in the night, Petrovsky Island,\r\n",
      "the wet paths, the wet grass, the wet trees and bushes and at last the\r\n",
      "bush.... He began ill-humouredly staring at the houses, trying to think\r\n",
      "of something else. There was not a cabman or a passer-by in the street.\r\n",
      "The bright yellow, wooden, little houses looked dirty and dejected with\r\n",
      "their closed shutters. The cold and damp penetrated his whole body and\r\n",
      "he began to shiver. From time to time he came across shop signs and read\r\n",
      "each carefully. At last he reached the end of the wooden pavement and\r\n",
      "came to a big stone house. A dirty, shivering dog crossed his path with\r\n",
      "its tail between its legs. A man in a greatcoat lay face downwards; dead\r\n",
      "drunk, across the pavement. He looked at him and went on. A high tower\r\n",
      "stood up on the left. “Bah!” he shouted, “here is a place. Why should\r\n",
      "it be Petrovsky? It will be in the presence of an official witness\r\n",
      "anyway....”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He almost smiled at this new thought and turned into the street where\r\n",
      "there was the big house with the tower. At the great closed gates of\r\n",
      "the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them,\r\n",
      "wrapped in a grey soldier’s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his\r\n",
      "head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His\r\n",
      "face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly\r\n",
      "printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both,\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes\r\n",
      "without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man\r\n",
      "not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a\r\n",
      "word.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What do you want here?” he said, without moving or changing his\r\n",
      "position.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Nothing, brother, good morning,” answered Svidrigaïlov.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“This isn’t the place.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The same day, about seven o’clock in the evening, Raskolnikov was on\r\n",
      "his way to his mother’s and sister’s lodging--the lodging in Bakaleyev’s\r\n",
      "house which Razumihin had found for them. The stairs went up from\r\n",
      "the street. Raskolnikov walked with lagging steps, as though still\r\n",
      "hesitating whether to go or not. But nothing would have turned him back:\r\n",
      "his decision was taken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Besides, it doesn’t matter, they still know nothing,” he thought, “and\r\n",
      "they are used to thinking of me as eccentric.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was appallingly dressed: his clothes torn and dirty, soaked with a\r\n",
      "night’s rain. His face was almost distorted from fatigue, exposure, the\r\n",
      "inward conflict that had lasted for twenty-four hours. He had spent all\r\n",
      "the previous night alone, God knows where. But anyway he had reached a\r\n",
      "decision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knocked at the door which was opened by his mother. Dounia was not\r\n",
      "at home. Even the servant happened to be out. At first Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna was speechless with joy and surprise; then she took him by\r\n",
      "the hand and drew him into the room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Here you are!” she began, faltering with joy. “Don’t be angry with\r\n",
      "me, Rodya, for welcoming you so foolishly with tears: I am laughing not\r\n",
      "crying. Did you think I was crying? No, I am delighted, but I’ve got\r\n",
      "into such a stupid habit of shedding tears. I’ve been like that ever\r\n",
      "since your father’s death. I cry for anything. Sit down, dear boy, you\r\n",

      "anxious, I understand, I understand it all: now I’ve learned the ways\r\n",

      "foolish one,’ I thought, ‘that’s what he is busy about; that’s the\r\n",
      "solution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may\r\n",
      "have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I\r\n",

      "sees himself in print; besides, he was only twenty-three. It lasted only\r\n",
      "a moment. After reading a few lines he frowned and his heart throbbed\r\n",

      "the day trying to persuade each other that that could not be, and both\r\n",
      "were less anxious while they were together. As soon as they parted, each\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“You see, Sonia, I’ve decided that it will be better so. There is one\r\n",

      "rather go to my friend, the Explosive Lieutenant; how I shall surprise\r\n",
      "him, what a sensation I shall make! But I must be cooler; I’ve become\r\n",
      "too irritable of late. You know I was nearly shaking my fist at my\r\n",
      "sister just now, because she turned to take a last look at me. It’s\r\n",

      "crosses?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed hardly to know what he was doing. He could not stay still or\r\n",

      "one another, he talked incoherently, his hands trembled slightly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without a word Sonia took out of the drawer two crosses, one of cypress\r\n",
      "wood and one of copper. She made the sign of the cross over herself and\r\n",
      "over him, and put the wooden cross on his neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“It’s the symbol of my taking up the cross,” he laughed. “As though I\r\n",
      "had not suffered much till now! The wooden cross, that is the peasant\r\n",
      "one; the copper one, that is Lizaveta’s--you will wear yourself, show\r\n",
      "me! So she had it on... at that moment? I remember two things like\r\n",
      "these too, a silver one and a little ikon. I threw them back on the old\r\n",
      "woman’s neck. Those would be appropriate now, really, those are what I\r\n",
      "ought to put on now.... But I am talking nonsense and forgetting what\r\n",
      "matters; I’m somehow forgetful.... You see I have come to warn you,\r\n",
      "Sonia, so that you might know... that’s all--that’s all I came for. But\r\n",
      "I thought I had more to say. You wanted me to go yourself. Well, now I\r\n",
      "am going to prison and you’ll have your wish. Well, what are you crying\r\n",
      "for? You too? Don’t. Leave off! Oh, how I hate it all!”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But his feeling was stirred; his heart ached, as he looked at her. “Why\r\n",
      "is she grieving too?” he thought to himself. “What am I to her? Why does\r\n",
      "she weep? Why is she looking after me, like my mother or Dounia? She’ll\r\n",
      "be my nurse.”\r\n",

      "Marmeladov had spoken, “the family shawl.” Raskolnikov thought of that\r\n",
      "looking at it, but he did not ask. He began to feel himself that he\r\n",
      "was certainly forgetting things and was disgustingly agitated. He was\r\n",
      "frightened at this. He was suddenly struck too by the thought that Sonia\r\n",
      "meant to go with him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“What are you doing? Where are you going? Stay here, stay! I’ll go\r\n",

      "towards the door. “What’s the use of going in procession?” he muttered\r\n",
      "going out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia remained standing in the middle of the room. He had not even said\r\n",
      "good-bye to her; he had forgotten her. A poignant and rebellious doubt\r\n",
      "surged in his heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Was it right, was it right, all this?” he thought again as he went down\r\n",
      "the stairs. “Couldn’t he stop and retract it all... and not go?”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But still he went. He felt suddenly once for all that he mustn’t ask\r\n",
      "himself questions. As he turned into the street he remembered that he\r\n",
      "had not said good-bye to Sonia, that he had left her in the middle of\r\n",
      "the room in her green shawl, not daring to stir after he had shouted\r\n",
      "at her, and he stopped short for a moment. At the same instant, another\r\n",
      "thought dawned upon him, as though it had been lying in wait to strike\r\n",
      "him then.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“Why, with what object did I go to her just now? I told her--on\r\n",

      "_going_; but where was the need? Do I love her? No, no, I drove her away\r\n",
      "just now like a dog. Did I want her crosses? Oh, how low I’ve sunk! No,\r\n",
      "I wanted her tears, I wanted to see her terror, to see how her heart\r\n",
      "ached! I had to have something to cling to, something to delay me, some\r\n",
      "friendly face to see! And I dared to believe in myself, to dream of what\r\n",

      "He walked along the canal bank, and he had not much further to go. But\r\n",
      "on reaching the bridge he stopped and turning out of his way along it\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He looked eagerly to right and left, gazed intently at every object and\r\n",
      "could not fix his attention on anything; everything slipped away. “In\r\n",

      "letters then? It’s written here ‘Campany,’ that’s a thing to remember,\r\n",
      "that letter _a_, and to look at it again in a month--how shall I look\r\n",
      "at it then? What shall I be feeling and thinking then?... How trivial\r\n",
      "it all must be, what I am fretting about now! Of course it must all be\r\n",
      "interesting... in its way... (Ha-ha-ha! What am I thinking about?) I am\r\n",

      "people shove! that fat man--a German he must be--who pushed against\r\n",
      "me, does he know whom he pushed? There’s a peasant woman with a baby,\r\n",
      "begging. It’s curious that she thinks me happier than she is. I might\r\n",
      "give her something, for the incongruity of it. Here’s a five copeck\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He went into the Hay Market. It was distasteful, very distasteful to be\r\n",
      "in a crowd, but he walked just where he saw most people. He would have\r\n",
      "given anything in the world to be alone; but he knew himself that he\r\n",
      "would not have remained alone for a moment. There was a man drunk and\r\n",
      "disorderly in the crowd; he kept trying to dance and falling down. There\r\n",
      "was a ring round him. Raskolnikov squeezed his way through the crowd,\r\n",
      "stared for some minutes at the drunken man and suddenly gave a short\r\n",
      "jerky laugh. A minute later he had forgotten him and did not see him,\r\n",
      "though he still stared. He moved away at last, not remembering where he\r\n",
      "was; but when he got into the middle of the square an emotion suddenly\r\n",
      "came over him, overwhelming him body and mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He suddenly recalled Sonia’s words, “Go to the cross-roads, bow down to\r\n",
      "the people, kiss the earth, for you have sinned against it too, and say\r\n",
      "aloud to the whole world, ‘I am a murderer.’” He trembled, remembering\r\n",
      "that. And the hopeless misery and anxiety of all that time, especially\r\n",
      "of the last hours, had weighed so heavily upon him that he positively\r\n",
      "clutched at the chance of this new unmixed, complete sensation. It came\r\n",
      "over him like a fit; it was like a single spark kindled in his soul and\r\n",
      "spreading fire through him. Everything in him softened at once and the\r\n",
      "tears started into his eyes. He fell to the earth on the spot....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He knelt down in the middle of the square, bowed down to the earth, and\r\n",
      "kissed that filthy earth with bliss and rapture. He got up and bowed\r\n",
      "down a second time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s boozed,” a youth near him observed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a roar of laughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“He’s going to Jerusalem, brothers, and saying good-bye to his children\r\n",
      "and his country. He’s bowing down to all the world and kissing the great\r\n",

      "little drunk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "“There’s no knowing who’s a gentleman and who isn’t nowadays.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These exclamations and remarks checked Raskolnikov, and the words, “I am\r\n",
      "a murderer,” which were perhaps on the point of dropping from his lips,\r\n",
      "died away. He bore these remarks quietly, however, and, without looking\r\n",
      "round, he turned down a street leading to the police office. He had a\r\n",
      "glimpse of something on the way which did not surprise him; he had felt\r\n",
      "that it must be so. The second time he bowed down in the Hay Market he\r\n",
      "saw, standing fifty paces from him on the left, Sonia. She was hiding\r\n",
      "from him behind one of the wooden shanties in the market-place. She had\r\n",
      "followed him then on his painful way! Raskolnikov at that moment felt\r\n",
      "and knew once for all that Sonia was with him for ever and would follow\r\n",
      "him to the ends of the earth, wherever fate might take him. It wrung his\r\n",
      "heart... but he was just reaching the fatal place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went into the yard fairly resolutely. He had to mount to the third\r\n",
      "storey. “I shall be some time going up,” he thought. He felt as though\r\n",
      "the fateful moment was still far off, as though he had plenty of time\r\n",
      "left for consideration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again the same rubbish, the same eggshells lying about on the spiral\r\n",
      "stairs, again the open doors of the flats, again the same kitchens and\r\n",
      "the same fumes and stench coming from them. Raskolnikov had not been\r\n",
      "here since that day. His legs were numb and gave way under him, but\r\n",
      "still they moved forward. He stopped for a moment to take breath, to\r\n",
      "collect himself, so as to enter _like a man_. “But why? what for?” he\r\n",
      "wondered, reflecting. “If I must drink the cup what difference does it\r\n",
      "make? The more revolting the better.” He imagined for an instant the\r\n",
      "figure of the “explosive lieutenant,” Ilya Petrovitch. Was he actually\r\n",
      "going to him? Couldn’t he go to someone else? To Nikodim Fomitch?\r\n",
      "Couldn’t he turn back and go straight to Nikodim Fomitch’s lodgings?\r\n",
      "At least then it would be done privately.... No, no! To the “explosive\r\n",
      "lieutenant”! If he must drink it, drink it off at once.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Turning cold and hardly conscious, he opened the door of the office.\r\n",
      "There were very few people in it this time--only a house porter and a\r\n",
      "peasant. The doorkeeper did not even peep out from behind his screen.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov walked into the next room. “Perhaps I still need not speak,”\r\n",
      " passed through his mind. Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was\r\n",
      "settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was\r\n",
      "seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There had been little difficulty about his trial. The criminal adhered\r\n",

      "misrepresent the facts, nor soften them in his own interest, nor omit\r\n",

      "to one another; how he afterwards had run downstairs and heard Nikolay\r\n",

      "The whole thing, in fact, was perfectly clear. The lawyers and the\r\n",
      "judges were very much struck, among other things, by the fact that he\r\n",
      "had hidden the trinkets and the purse under a stone, without making\r\n",
      "use of them, and that, what was more, he did not now remember what the\r\n",
      "trinkets were like, or even how many there were. The fact that he had\r\n",
      "never opened the purse and did not even know how much was in it seemed\r\n",
      "incredible. There turned out to be in the purse three hundred and\r\n",
      "seventeen roubles and sixty copecks. From being so long under the stone,\r\n",
      "some of the most valuable notes lying uppermost had suffered from the\r\n",
      "damp. They were a long while trying to discover why the accused man\r\n",
      "should tell a lie about this, when about everything else he had made\r\n",
      "a truthful and straightforward confession. Finally some of the lawyers\r\n",
      "more versed in psychology admitted that it was possible he had really\r\n",
      "not looked into the purse, and so didn’t know what was in it when he\r\n",
      "hid it under the stone. But they immediately drew the deduction that\r\n",
      "the crime could only have been committed through temporary mental\r\n",
      "derangement, through homicidal mania, without object or the pursuit of\r\n",
      "gain. This fell in with the most recent fashionable theory of temporary\r\n",
      "insanity, so often applied in our days in criminal cases. Moreover\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov’s hypochondriacal condition was proved by many witnesses, by\r\n",
      "Dr. Zossimov, his former fellow students, his landlady and her servant.\r\n",
      "All this pointed strongly to the conclusion that Raskolnikov was not\r\n",
      "quite like an ordinary murderer and robber, but that there was another\r\n",
      "element in the case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To the intense annoyance of those who maintained this opinion, the\r\n",
      "criminal scarcely attempted to defend himself. To the decisive question\r\n",
      "as to what motive impelled him to the murder and the robbery, he\r\n",
      "answered very clearly with the coarsest frankness that the cause was\r\n",
      "his miserable position, his poverty and helplessness, and his desire to\r\n",
      "provide for his first steps in life by the help of the three thousand\r\n",
      "roubles he had reckoned on finding. He had been led to the murder\r\n",
      "through his shallow and cowardly nature, exasperated moreover by\r\n",
      "privation and failure. To the question what led him to confess, he\r\n",
      "answered that it was his heartfelt repentance. All this was almost\r\n",
      "coarse....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sentence however was more merciful than could have been expected,\r\n",
      "perhaps partly because the criminal had not tried to justify himself,\r\n",
      "but had rather shown a desire to exaggerate his guilt. All the strange\r\n",
      "and peculiar circumstances of the crime were taken into consideration.\r\n",
      "There could be no doubt of the abnormal and poverty-stricken condition\r\n",
      "of the criminal at the time. The fact that he had made no use of what he\r\n",
      "had stolen was put down partly to the effect of remorse, partly to his\r\n",
      "abnormal mental condition at the time of the crime. Incidentally the\r\n",
      "murder of Lizaveta served indeed to confirm the last hypothesis: a man\r\n",
      "commits two murders and forgets that the door is open! Finally, the\r\n",
      "confession, at the very moment when the case was hopelessly muddled by\r\n",
      "the false evidence given by Nikolay through melancholy and fanaticism,\r\n",
      "and when, moreover, there were no proofs against the real criminal, no\r\n",
      "suspicions even (Porfiry Petrovitch fully kept his word)--all this did\r\n",
      "much to soften the sentence. Other circumstances, too, in the prisoner’s\r\n",
      "favour came out quite unexpectedly. Razumihin somehow discovered and\r\n",
      "proved that while Raskolnikov was at the university he had helped a poor\r\n",
      "consumptive fellow student and had spent his last penny on supporting\r\n",
      "him for six months, and when this student died, leaving a decrepit\r\n",
      "old father whom he had maintained almost from his thirteenth year,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had got the old man into a hospital and paid for his funeral\r\n",
      "when he died. Raskolnikov’s landlady bore witness, too, that when they\r\n",
      "had lived in another house at Five Corners, Raskolnikov had rescued two\r\n",
      "little children from a house on fire and was burnt in doing so. This was\r\n",
      "investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts\r\n",
      "made an impression in his favour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating\r\n",
      "circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a\r\n",
      "term of eight years only.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov’s mother fell ill. Dounia\r\n",
      "and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the\r\n",
      "trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so\r\n",
      "as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time\r\n",
      "to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible. Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s\r\n",
      "illness was a strange nervous one and was accompanied by a partial\r\n",
      "derangement of her intellect.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When Dounia returned from her last interview with her brother, she\r\n",
      "had found her mother already ill, in feverish delirium. That evening\r\n",
      "Razumihin and she agreed what answers they must make to her mother’s\r\n",
      "questions about Raskolnikov and made up a complete story for her\r\n",
      "mother’s benefit of his having to go away to a distant part of Russia\r\n",
      "on a business commission, which would bring him in the end money and\r\n",
      "reputation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But they were struck by the fact that Pulcheria Alexandrovna never\r\n",
      "asked them anything on the subject, neither then nor thereafter. On the\r\n",
      "contrary, she had her own version of her son’s sudden departure; she\r\n",
      "told them with tears how he had come to say good-bye to her, hinting\r\n",
      "that she alone knew many mysterious and important facts, and that Rodya\r\n",
      "had many very powerful enemies, so that it was necessary for him to be\r\n",
      "in hiding. As for his future career, she had no doubt that it would be\r\n",
      "brilliant when certain sinister influences could be removed. She assured\r\n",
      "Razumihin that her son would be one day a great statesman, that his\r\n",
      "article and brilliant literary talent proved it. This article she was\r\n",
      "continually reading, she even read it aloud, almost took it to bed\r\n",
      "with her, but scarcely asked where Rodya was, though the subject was\r\n",
      "obviously avoided by the others, which might have been enough to awaken\r\n",
      "her suspicions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They began to be frightened at last at Pulcheria Alexandrovna’s strange\r\n",
      "silence on certain subjects. She did not, for instance, complain of\r\n",
      "getting no letters from him, though in previous years she had only lived\r\n",
      "on the hope of letters from her beloved Rodya. This was the cause of\r\n",
      "great uneasiness to Dounia; the idea occurred to her that her mother\r\n",
      "suspected that there was something terrible in her son’s fate and was\r\n",
      "afraid to ask, for fear of hearing something still more awful. In any\r\n",
      "case, Dounia saw clearly that her mother was not in full possession of\r\n",
      "her faculties.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It happened once or twice, however, that Pulcheria Alexandrovna gave\r\n",
      "such a turn to the conversation that it was impossible to answer her\r\n",
      "without mentioning where Rodya was, and on receiving unsatisfactory and\r\n",
      "suspicious answers she became at once gloomy and silent, and this mood\r\n",
      "lasted for a long time. Dounia saw at last that it was hard to deceive\r\n",
      "her and came to the conclusion that it was better to be absolutely\r\n",
      "silent on certain points; but it became more and more evident that\r\n",
      "the poor mother suspected something terrible. Dounia remembered her\r\n",
      "brother’s telling her that her mother had overheard her talking in her\r\n",
      "sleep on the night after her interview with Svidrigaïlov and before the\r\n",
      "fatal day of the confession: had not she made out something from that?\r\n",
      "Sometimes days and even weeks of gloomy silence and tears would be\r\n",
      "succeeded by a period of hysterical animation, and the invalid would\r\n",
      "begin to talk almost incessantly of her son, of her hopes of his\r\n",
      "future.... Her fancies were sometimes very strange. They humoured her,\r\n",
      "pretended to agree with her (she saw perhaps that they were pretending),\r\n",
      "but she still went on talking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Five months after Raskolnikov’s confession, he was sentenced. Razumihin\r\n",
      "and Sonia saw him in prison as often as it was possible. At last\r\n",
      "the moment of separation came. Dounia swore to her brother that the\r\n",
      "separation should not be for ever, Razumihin did the same. Razumihin, in\r\n",
      "his youthful ardour, had firmly resolved to lay the foundations at least\r\n",
      "of a secure livelihood during the next three or four years, and saving\r\n",
      "up a certain sum, to emigrate to Siberia, a country rich in every\r\n",
      "natural resource and in need of workers, active men and capital. There\r\n",
      "they would settle in the town where Rodya was and all together would\r\n",
      "begin a new life. They all wept at parting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had been very dreamy for a few days before. He asked a great\r\n",
      "deal about his mother and was constantly anxious about her. He worried\r\n",
      "so much about her that it alarmed Dounia. When he heard about his\r\n",
      "mother’s illness he became very gloomy. With Sonia he was particularly\r\n",
      "reserved all the time. With the help of the money left to her by\r\n",
      "Svidrigaïlov, Sonia had long ago made her preparations to follow the\r\n",
      "party of convicts in which he was despatched to Siberia. Not a word\r\n",
      "passed between Raskolnikov and her on the subject, but both knew it\r\n",
      "would be so. At the final leave-taking he smiled strangely at his\r\n",
      "sister’s and Razumihin’s fervent anticipations of their happy future\r\n",
      "together when he should come out of prison. He predicted that their\r\n",

      "set off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "During all this period Razumihin wore an air of resolute determination.\r\n",
      "Dounia put implicit faith in his carrying out his plans and indeed she\r\n",
      "could not but believe in him. He displayed a rare strength of will.\r\n",
      "Among other things he began attending university lectures again in order\r\n",
      "to take his degree. They were continually making plans for the future;\r\n",
      "both counted on settling in Siberia within five years at least. Till\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Pulcheria Alexandrovna was delighted to give her blessing to Dounia’s\r\n",
      "marriage with Razumihin; but after the marriage she became even more\r\n",
      "melancholy and anxious. To give her pleasure Razumihin told her how\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov had looked after the poor student and his decrepit father\r\n",
      "and how a year ago he had been burnt and injured in rescuing two\r\n",
      "little children from a fire. These two pieces of news excited Pulcheria\r\n",
      "Alexandrovna’s disordered imagination almost to ecstasy. She was\r\n",
      "continually talking about them, even entering into conversation with\r\n",
      "strangers in the street, though Dounia always accompanied her. In public\r\n",
      "conveyances and shops, wherever she could capture a listener, she would\r\n",
      "begin the discourse about her son, his article, how he had helped the\r\n",
      "student, how he had been burnt at the fire, and so on! Dounia did\r\n",
      "not know how to restrain her. Apart from the danger of her morbid\r\n",
      "excitement, there was the risk of someone’s recalling Raskolnikov’s name\r\n",
      "and speaking of the recent trial. Pulcheria Alexandrovna found out the\r\n",
      "address of the mother of the two children her son had saved and insisted\r\n",
      "on going to see her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last her restlessness reached an extreme point. She would sometimes\r\n",
      "begin to cry suddenly and was often ill and feverishly delirious. One\r\n",
      "morning she declared that by her reckoning Rodya ought soon to be home,\r\n",
      "that she remembered when he said good-bye to her he said that they must\r\n",
      "expect him back in nine months. She began to prepare for his coming,\r\n",
      "began to do up her room for him, to clean the furniture, to wash and\r\n",
      "put up new hangings and so on. Dounia was anxious, but said nothing and\r\n",
      "helped her to arrange the room. After a fatiguing day spent in continual\r\n",
      "fancies, in joyful day-dreams and tears, Pulcheria Alexandrovna was\r\n",
      "taken ill in the night and by morning she was feverish and delirious.\r\n",
      "It was brain fever. She died within a fortnight. In her delirium she\r\n",
      "dropped words which showed that she knew a great deal more about her\r\n",
      "son’s terrible fate than they had supposed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a long time Raskolnikov did not know of his mother’s death, though\r\n",
      "a regular correspondence had been maintained from the time he reached\r\n",
      "Siberia. It was carried on by means of Sonia, who wrote every month\r\n",
      "to the Razumihins and received an answer with unfailing regularity. At\r\n",
      "first they found Sonia’s letters dry and unsatisfactory, but later on\r\n",
      "they came to the conclusion that the letters could not be better, for\r\n",
      "from these letters they received a complete picture of their unfortunate\r\n",
      "brother’s life. Sonia’s letters were full of the most matter-of-fact\r\n",
      "detail, the simplest and clearest description of all Raskolnikov’s\r\n",
      "surroundings as a convict. There was no word of her own hopes, no\r\n",
      "conjecture as to the future, no description of her feelings. Instead of\r\n",
      "any attempt to interpret his state of mind and inner life, she gave the\r\n",
      "simple facts--that is, his own words, an exact account of his health,\r\n",
      "what he asked for at their interviews, what commission he gave her\r\n",
      "and so on. All these facts she gave with extraordinary minuteness. The\r\n",
      "picture of their unhappy brother stood out at last with great clearness\r\n",
      "and precision. There could be no mistake, because nothing was given but\r\n",
      "facts.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Dounia and her husband could get little comfort out of the news,\r\n",
      "especially at first. Sonia wrote that he was constantly sullen and not\r\n",
      "ready to talk, that he scarcely seemed interested in the news she gave\r\n",
      "him from their letters, that he sometimes asked after his mother and\r\n",
      "that when, seeing that he had guessed the truth, she told him at last\r\n",
      "of her death, she was surprised to find that he did not seem greatly\r\n",
      "affected by it, not externally at any rate. She told them that, although\r\n",
      "he seemed so wrapped up in himself and, as it were, shut himself off\r\n",
      "from everyone--he took a very direct and simple view of his new life;\r\n",
      "that he understood his position, expected nothing better for the time,\r\n",
      "had no ill-founded hopes (as is so common in his position) and scarcely\r\n",
      "seemed surprised at anything in his surroundings, so unlike anything he\r\n",
      "had known before. She wrote that his health was satisfactory; he did his\r\n",
      "work without shirking or seeking to do more; he was almost indifferent\r\n",

      "further that in prison he shared the same room with the rest, that she\r\n",
      "had not seen the inside of their barracks, but concluded that they were\r\n",
      "crowded, miserable and unhealthy; that he slept on a plank bed with a\r\n",
      "rug under him and was unwilling to make any other arrangement. But that\r\n",
      "he lived so poorly and roughly, not from any plan or design, but simply\r\n",
      "from inattention and indifference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sonia wrote simply that he had at first shown no interest in her visits,\r\n",
      "had almost been vexed with her indeed for coming, unwilling to talk and\r\n",
      "rude to her. But that in the end these visits had become a habit and\r\n",
      "almost a necessity for him, so that he was positively distressed when\r\n",
      "she was ill for some days and could not visit him. She used to see him\r\n",
      "on holidays at the prison gates or in the guard-room, to which he was\r\n",
      "brought for a few minutes to see her. On working days she would go to\r\n",

      "sheds on the banks of the Irtish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About herself, Sonia wrote that she had succeeded in making some\r\n",
      "acquaintances in the town, that she did sewing, and, as there\r\n",
      "was scarcely a dressmaker in the town, she was looked upon as an\r\n",
      "indispensable person in many houses. But she did not mention that the\r\n",

      "the hard labour, the bad food, the shaven head, or the patched clothes\r\n",
      "that crushed him. What did he care for all those trials and hardships!\r\n",
      "he was even glad of the hard work. Physically exhausted, he could at\r\n",
      "least reckon on a few hours of quiet sleep. And what was the food to\r\n",
      "him--the thin cabbage soup with beetles floating in it? In the past as a\r\n",
      "student he had often not had even that. His clothes were warm and suited\r\n",

      "conscience found no particularly terrible fault in his past, except\r\n",
      "a simple _blunder_ which might happen to anyone. He was ashamed just\r\n",
      "because he, Raskolnikov, had so hopelessly, stupidly come to grief\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And if only fate would have sent him repentance--burning repentance that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "“In what way,” he asked himself, “was my theory stupider than others\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He preferred to attribute it to the dead weight of instinct which he\r\n",
      "could not step over, again through weakness and meanness. He looked at\r\n",
      "his fellow prisoners and was amazed to see how they all loved life and\r\n",
      "prized it. It seemed to him that they loved and valued life more in\r\n",
      "prison than in freedom. What terrible agonies and privations some of\r\n",

      "longed to see again, as he might to see his sweetheart, dreaming of the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In prison, of course, there was a great deal he did not see and did not\r\n",
      "want to see; he lived as it were with downcast eyes. It was loathsome\r\n",
      "and unbearable for him to look. But in the end there was much that\r\n",
      "surprised him and he began, as it were involuntarily, to notice much\r\n",
      "that he had not suspected before. What surprised him most of all was\r\n",
      "the terrible impossible gulf that lay between him and all the rest. They\r\n",
      "seemed to be a different species, and he looked at them and they at\r\n",
      "him with distrust and hostility. He felt and knew the reasons of his\r\n",
      "isolation, but he would never have admitted till then that those reasons\r\n",
      "were so deep and strong. There were some Polish exiles, political\r\n",
      "prisoners, among them. They simply looked down upon all the rest as\r\n",
      "ignorant churls; but Raskolnikov could not look upon them like that.\r\n",
      "He saw that these ignorant men were in many respects far wiser than the\r\n",
      "Poles. There were some Russians who were just as contemptuous, a former\r\n",
      "officer and two seminarists. Raskolnikov saw their mistake as clearly.\r\n",
      "He was disliked and avoided by everyone; they even began to hate him at\r\n",
      "last--why, he could not tell. Men who had been far more guilty despised\r\n",
      "and laughed at his crime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "“You’re a gentleman,” they used to say. “You shouldn’t hack about with\r\n",
      "an axe; that’s not a gentleman’s work.”\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The second week in Lent, his turn came to take the sacrament with his\r\n",
      "gang. He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to\r\n",
      "kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at\r\n",
      "him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently;\r\n",
      "his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch. The guard\r\n",
      "succeeded in intervening between him and his assailant, or there would\r\n",

      "There was another question he could not decide: why were they all so\r\n",

      "everybody knew her, they knew that she had come out to follow _him_,\r\n",
      "knew how and where she lived. She never gave them money, did them no\r\n",
      "particular services. Only once at Christmas she sent them all presents\r\n",
      "of pies and rolls. But by degrees closer relations sprang up between\r\n",
      "them and Sonia. She would write and post letters for them to their\r\n",
      "relations. Relations of the prisoners who visited the town, at their\r\n",
      "instructions, left with Sonia presents and money for them. Their wives\r\n",
      "and sweethearts knew her and used to visit her. And when she visited\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov at work, or met a party of the prisoners on the road, they\r\n",
      "all took off their hats to her. “Little mother Sofya Semyonovna, you\r\n",
      "are our dear, good little mother,” coarse branded criminals said to that\r\n",
      "frail little creature. She would smile and bow to them and everyone was\r\n",
      "delighted when she smiled. They even admired her gait and turned round\r\n",
      "to watch her walking; they admired her too for being so little, and, in\r\n",
      "fact, did not know what to admire her most for. They even came to her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He was in the hospital from the middle of Lent till after Easter. When\r\n",
      "he was better, he remembered the dreams he had had while he was feverish\r\n",
      "and delirious. He dreamt that the whole world was condemned to a\r\n",
      "terrible new strange plague that had come to Europe from the depths of\r\n",
      "Asia. All were to be destroyed except a very few chosen. Some new sorts\r\n",
      "of microbes were attacking the bodies of men, but these microbes were\r\n",
      "endowed with intelligence and will. Men attacked by them became at once\r\n",
      "mad and furious. But never had men considered themselves so intellectual\r\n",
      "and so completely in possession of the truth as these sufferers, never\r\n",
      "had they considered their decisions, their scientific conclusions, their\r\n",
      "moral convictions so infallible. Whole villages, whole towns and peoples\r\n",
      "went mad from the infection. All were excited and did not understand\r\n",
      "one another. Each thought that he alone had the truth and was wretched\r\n",
      "looking at the others, beat himself on the breast, wept, and wrung\r\n",
      "his hands. They did not know how to judge and could not agree what to\r\n",
      "consider evil and what good; they did not know whom to blame, whom\r\n",
      "to justify. Men killed each other in a sort of senseless spite. They\r\n",
      "gathered together in armies against one another, but even on the march\r\n",
      "the armies would begin attacking each other, the ranks would be broken\r\n",
      "and the soldiers would fall on each other, stabbing and cutting, biting\r\n",
      "and devouring each other. The alarm bell was ringing all day long in\r\n",
      "the towns; men rushed together, but why they were summoned and who was\r\n",
      "summoning them no one knew. The most ordinary trades were abandoned,\r\n",
      "because everyone proposed his own ideas, his own improvements, and they\r\n",
      "could not agree. The land too was abandoned. Men met in groups, agreed\r\n",
      "on something, swore to keep together, but at once began on something\r\n",
      "quite different from what they had proposed. They accused one another,\r\n",
      "fought and killed each other. There were conflagrations and famine. All\r\n",
      "men and all things were involved in destruction. The plague spread and\r\n",
      "moved further and further. Only a few men could be saved in the whole\r\n",
      "world. They were a pure chosen people, destined to found a new race and\r\n",
      "a new life, to renew and purify the earth, but no one had seen these\r\n",
      "men, no one had heard their words and their voices.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov was worried that this senseless dream haunted his memory so\r\n",
      "miserably, the impression of this feverish delirium persisted so long.\r\n",
      "The second week after Easter had come. There were warm bright spring\r\n",
      "days; in the prison ward the grating windows under which the sentinel\r\n",
      "paced were opened. Sonia had only been able to visit him twice during\r\n",
      "his illness; each time she had to obtain permission, and it was\r\n",
      "difficult. But she often used to come to the hospital yard, especially\r\n",
      "in the evening, sometimes only to stand a minute and look up at the\r\n",
      "windows of the ward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One evening, when he was almost well again, Raskolnikov fell asleep. On\r\n",
      "waking up he chanced to go to the window, and at once saw Sonia in the\r\n",
      "distance at the hospital gate. She seemed to be waiting for someone.\r\n",
      "Something stabbed him to the heart at that minute. He shuddered and\r\n",
      "moved away from the window. Next day Sonia did not come, nor the day\r\n",
      "after; he noticed that he was expecting her uneasily. At last he was\r\n",
      "discharged. On reaching the prison he learnt from the convicts that\r\n",
      "Sofya Semyonovna was lying ill at home and was unable to go out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was very uneasy and sent to inquire after her; he soon learnt that\r\n",
      "her illness was not dangerous. Hearing that he was anxious about her,\r\n",
      "Sonia sent him a pencilled note, telling him that she was much better,\r\n",
      "that she had a slight cold and that she would soon, very soon come and\r\n",
      "see him at his work. His heart throbbed painfully as he read it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Again it was a warm bright day. Early in the morning, at six o’clock, he\r\n",
      "went off to work on the river bank, where they used to pound alabaster\r\n",
      "and where there was a kiln for baking it in a shed. There were only\r\n",
      "three of them sent. One of the convicts went with the guard to the\r\n",
      "fortress to fetch a tool; the other began getting the wood ready and\r\n",
      "laying it in the kiln. Raskolnikov came out of the shed on to the river\r\n",
      "bank, sat down on a heap of logs by the shed and began gazing at the\r\n",
      "wide deserted river. From the high bank a broad landscape opened before\r\n",
      "him, the sound of singing floated faintly audible from the other bank.\r\n",
      "In the vast steppe, bathed in sunshine, he could just see, like black\r\n",
      "specks, the nomads’ tents. There there was freedom, there other men were\r\n",
      "living, utterly unlike those here; there time itself seemed to stand\r\n",
      "still, as though the age of Abraham and his flocks had not passed.\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov sat gazing, his thoughts passed into day-dreams, into\r\n",
      "contemplation; he thought of nothing, but a vague restlessness excited\r\n",
      "and troubled him. Suddenly he found Sonia beside him; she had come up\r\n",
      "noiselessly and sat down at his side. It was still quite early; the\r\n",
      "morning chill was still keen. She wore her poor old burnous and the\r\n",
      "green shawl; her face still showed signs of illness, it was thinner and\r\n",
      "paler. She gave him a joyful smile of welcome, but held out her hand\r\n",
      "with her usual timidity. She was always timid of holding out her hand\r\n",
      "to him and sometimes did not offer it at all, as though afraid he would\r\n",
      "repel it. He always took her hand as though with repugnance, always\r\n",
      "seemed vexed to meet her and was sometimes obstinately silent throughout\r\n",
      "her visit. Sometimes she trembled before him and went away deeply\r\n",
      "grieved. But now their hands did not part. He stole a rapid glance\r\n",
      "at her and dropped his eyes on the ground without speaking. They were\r\n",
      "alone, no one had seen them. The guard had turned away for the time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How it happened he did not know. But all at once something seemed to\r\n",
      "seize him and fling him at her feet. He wept and threw his arms round\r\n",
      "her knees. For the first instant she was terribly frightened and she\r\n",
      "turned pale. She jumped up and looked at him trembling. But at the same\r\n",
      "moment she understood, and a light of infinite happiness came into her\r\n",
      "eyes. She knew and had no doubt that he loved her beyond everything and\r\n",
      "that at last the moment had come....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They wanted to speak, but could not; tears stood in their eyes. They\r\n",
      "were both pale and thin; but those sick pale faces were bright with the\r\n",
      "dawn of a new future, of a full resurrection into a new life. They were\r\n",
      "renewed by love; the heart of each held infinite sources of life for the\r\n",
      "heart of the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They resolved to wait and be patient. They had another seven years to\r\n",
      "wait, and what terrible suffering and what infinite happiness before\r\n",
      "them! But he had risen again and he knew it and felt it in all his\r\n",
      "being, while she--she only lived in his life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the evening of the same day, when the barracks were locked,\r\n",
      "Raskolnikov lay on his plank bed and thought of her. He had even fancied\r\n",
      "that day that all the convicts who had been his enemies looked at him\r\n",
      "differently; he had even entered into talk with them and they answered\r\n",
      "him in a friendly way. He remembered that now, and thought it was bound\r\n",
      "to be so. Wasn’t everything now bound to be changed?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought of her. He remembered how continually he had tormented her\r\n",
      "and wounded her heart. He remembered her pale and thin little face.\r\n",
      "But these recollections scarcely troubled him now; he knew with what\r\n",
      "infinite love he would now repay all her sufferings. And what were all,\r\n",
      "_all_ the agonies of the past! Everything, even his crime, his sentence\r\n",
      "and imprisonment, seemed to him now in the first rush of feeling an\r\n",
      "external, strange fact with which he had no concern. But he could not\r\n",
      "think for long together of anything that evening, and he could not have\r\n",
      "analysed anything consciously; he was simply feeling. Life had stepped\r\n",
      "into the place of theory and something quite different would work itself\r\n",
      "out in his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under his pillow lay the New Testament. He took it up mechanically.\r\n",
      "The book belonged to Sonia; it was the one from which she had read the\r\n",
      "raising of Lazarus to him. At first he was afraid that she would worry\r\n",
      "him about religion, would talk about the gospel and pester him with\r\n",
      "books. But to his great surprise she had not once approached the subject\r\n",
      "and had not even offered him the Testament. He had asked her for it\r\n",
      "himself not long before his illness and she brought him the book without\r\n",
